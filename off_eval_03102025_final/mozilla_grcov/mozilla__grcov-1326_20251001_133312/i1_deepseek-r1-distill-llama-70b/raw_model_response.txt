Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about Jacoco parsing reports from Kotlin, which don't require a single top-level class. The patch modifies the parser to handle this by using the sourcefile name as the key instead of the class name.

Looking at the patch, I see that the test section was changed. Previously, there were tests that expected a panic when non-top-level classes were present. Now, those tests are replaced with a new test `test_parser_jacoco_kotlin` which reads a Kotlin-specific Jacoco report and asserts the results.

So, the patch already includes a test that should fail before the changes and pass after. Therefore, no additional test is needed beyond what's already provided.

I should return <NO> because the necessary test is already included in the patch.
