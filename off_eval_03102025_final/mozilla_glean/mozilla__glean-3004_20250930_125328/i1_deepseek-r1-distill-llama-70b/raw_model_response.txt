Alright, I need to figure out how to create a regression test for the given patch. Let's start by understanding the issue and the changes made.

The issue is about accessing certain debug values via the Glean API. Specifically, the user wants to retrieve the current debug view tag, log pings value, and a list of all registered ping types. The problem arises when the debug menu is disabled and re-enabled, causing the UI to not update correctly because it can't get these values from Glean.

Looking at the patch, I see that new functions have been added to the Glean API:

1. `glean_get_debug_view_tag()` which returns an `Option<String>`.
2. `glean_get_log_pings()` which returns a `bool`.
3. `get_registered_ping_names()` which returns a `Vec<String>`.

These functions are implemented in `lib.rs` and `core/mod.rs`. The patch also modifies some existing functions to make them public, like `debug_view_tag()` and `log_pings()`, which were previously `pub(crate)`.

Now, to create a regression test, I need to ensure that these new functions behave correctly. The test should fail before the patch and pass after. 

I should test each function individually:

- For `glean_get_debug_view_tag()`, I'll set a tag using `glean_set_debug_view_tag()`, then check if retrieving it returns the correct value.
- For `glean_get_log_pings()`, I'll set the log pings to `true` and `false`, then verify the retrieved value matches.
- For `get_registered_ping_names()`, I'll check that it returns a non-empty list of ping names, including a known ping like "baseline".

I need to structure the test to cover all these cases. I'll write a single test function that performs each check in sequence.

I should import the necessary functions using `super::` since they're in the parent module. Also, I'll need to import `is_some` and `is_none` from `std::option` for assertions.

The test will:

1. Set a debug view tag and assert that getting it back is correct.
2. Set log pings to `true`, assert it's retrieved correctly, then set it to `false` and check again.
3. Call `get_registered_ping_names()` and verify it's not empty and contains "baseline".

This should ensure that the new functions work as intended after the patch.
