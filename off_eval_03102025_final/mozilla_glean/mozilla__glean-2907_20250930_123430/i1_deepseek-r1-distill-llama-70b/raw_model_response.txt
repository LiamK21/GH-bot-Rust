Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is about updating the rust codegen template in glean_parser to account for changes in how labeled_* metrics are constructed. The patch provided changes the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION from "14.2.0" to "14.3.0".

So, the problem was that the codegen wasn't updated, causing issues. The patch corrects this by updating the version. Now, I need to determine if a test is needed. Since the patch is a version bump, perhaps the test would ensure that the version is correctly set.

I should check if there's existing code that uses this constant. If the Builder struct or other parts of the code rely on GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, then a test making sure it's set to the correct version would be useful.

The test should fail before the patch because the version would be 14.2.0, and after the patch, it should be 14.3.0. So, the test can simply check the value of GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION.

I don't think I need any external libraries for this test. It's a straightforward check, so I can write it using the standard library.

Now, I'll structure the test. The filename is glean-core/build/src/lib.rs. The test function will be test_glean_parser_version. It will assert that the constant equals "14.3.0".

I need to make sure to import the constant correctly. Since it's in the same file, I can use super::GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION.

So, the test will look like this: it initializes the expected version, then asserts that the actual version from the constant matches.

The patch updates the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION constant, so a test is needed to verify this change.

<Filename>glean-core/build/src/lib.rs</Filename>
<imports>use super::GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION;</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_glean_parser_version() {
    let expected_version = "14.3.0";
    assert_eq!(GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, expected_version);
}</Rust>
