Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. Let's see what the patch does. 

The patch is in the file `glean-core/build/src/lib.rs`, and it's changing the `GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION` constant from "6.4.0" to "7.0.0". That's a version bump. The issue mentions removing old event API code and migrating to the new one, which probably means the new parser version is compatible with these changes.

Now, the question is: do I need a test for this change? Well, the patch itself is just a version bump. But if the version bump is crucial for the functionality, like ensuring that the new parser is used, then a test might be necessary to verify that the correct version is being used.

Looking at the code, the `Builder` struct uses this version to generate Rust bindings. So if the version is wrong, it might cause issues with the bindings. Therefore, a test that checks the value of `GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION` would be useful to ensure it's correctly set after the patch.

I should write a unit test that checks the value of `GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION`. Before the patch, this would be "6.4.0", and after, it should be "7.0.0". The test should fail before the patch and pass after, confirming that the change is effective.

So, the test will be straightforward. It'll compare the constant's value to "7.0.0". Since the constant is in the same file, I can access it directly without any issues. I don't need any external libraries or mocks because it's a simple value check.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained and only includes necessary imports. Since the test is in the same file, I don't need to import anything else. The function under test is just a constant, so no additional setup is required.

Putting it all together, the test will be named `test_glean_parser_version` to clearly indicate what it's checking. It'll initialize the expected version as a string, then assert that the constant equals this expected value. If it does, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

This should cover the necessary verification that the patch correctly updates the version, ensuring that any dependent code uses the new parser version.
