Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about clearing the dirty bit when shutting down in the RLB. The patch adds code to launch a dispatcher that sets the dirty flag to false during shutdown. 

Looking at the provided patch, I see that a test `no_dirty_baseline_on_clean_shutdowns` was added in `test.rs`. This test seems to check if the dirty bit is cleared upon clean shutdown, ensuring no baseline ping is sent. 

Now, I should determine if this test is sufficient or if another test is needed. The test in the patch already simulates a clean shutdown and checks that the baseline ping isn't generated. It uses a fake uploader to monitor the ping URL. 

I think this test covers the scenario where the dirty bit is cleared. It verifies that after a clean shutdown and restart, the dirty bit remains false, so no baseline ping is sent. Therefore, no additional test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch. 

The existing test should fail before the patch because the dirty bit wasn't cleared, causing a baseline ping. After the patch, the test should pass because the dirty bit is cleared, and no ping is sent. 

So, I conclude that no new test is required. The existing one in the patch is adequate.
