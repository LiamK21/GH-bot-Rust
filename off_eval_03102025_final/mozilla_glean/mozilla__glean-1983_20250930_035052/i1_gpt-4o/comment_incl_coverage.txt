Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 9.94%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_x_telemetry_agent_header_value() {
    let version = "1.0.0";
    let language_binding_name = "Rust";
    let system = "Linux";

    let expected = "Glean/1.0.0 (Rust on Linux)";
    let actual = create_x_telemetry_agent_header_value(version, language_binding_name, system);

    assert_eq!(expected, actual);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/upload/request.rs` file before running it.
