Okay, so I need to figure out if a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about adding limits to the extra fields in experiments. The patch adds maximum lengths for keys, values, and the number of extra fields. 

Looking at the patch, I see that in the `glean-core/src/lib.rs` file, a test called `limits_on_experiments_extras_are_applied_correctly` was added. This test creates an experiment with extra fields that exceed the limits and checks if they are truncated correctly. 

But wait, is this test sufficient? It does cover the case where the extras are too long, but maybe there are other scenarios. For example, what if the extras are exactly at the limit? Or what if some keys are within the limit and others are over? Also, the test might not cover the case where the number of extra keys exceeds the maximum allowed.

I should check if the existing test covers all possible cases. The current test adds 21 extra keys, which is over the 20 limit, so it checks that only 20 are kept. It also uses very long keys and values, so it tests truncation. But perhaps another test is needed to ensure that when the extras are within the limits, they are not modified. Or maybe a test where some keys are over and some are under.

However, the user's instructions say to write exactly one test if needed. Since the patch already includes a test, maybe no additional test is needed. But wait, the existing test is in the `glean-core/src/lib.rs` file, and perhaps more tests are needed in other files.

Alternatively, maybe the existing test is comprehensive enough. It tests the limits by exceeding them and checks that the data is truncated. So perhaps no additional test is necessary beyond what's already in the patch.

But the user is asking if a unit test is needed, and the patch already includes one. So maybe the answer is that no new test is needed because the patch already adds a test. Therefore, the response should be <NO>.
