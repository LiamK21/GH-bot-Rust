Okay, so I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue was that the experimentation_id could only be set during initialization, which is a problem for use cases where it changes, like when a user logs in or out. The patch adds a new function, set_experimentation_id, which allows dynamic changes.

First, I should check if the patch introduces any new functionality that needs testing. Since this is a new API, it's crucial to test that it works as intended. Without a test, we can't be sure that the function behaves correctly, especially in different scenarios.

Next, I need to determine if the test can be written using the Rust standard library. The function being tested is part of the public API, so a unit test should be feasible without external dependencies. We can test it by setting the experimentation_id and then checking if it's correctly retrieved.

I should also consider how the test will verify the behavior. The test should fail before the patch because the functionality doesn't exist, and pass after the patch is applied. So, the test will call the new function and assert that the experimentation_id is updated.

Looking at the provided code, there's already a test function, test_get_experimentation_id, which returns the current id. That function can be used in the test to check the value after setting it.

So, the test will:
1. Set a new experimentation_id using the new function.
2. Retrieve the current id using test_get_experimentation_id.
3. Assert that the retrieved id matches the one set.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll include all necessary use statements. Also, I should avoid any group imports and only import what's needed.

The filename where the test should be added is glean-core/rlb/src/lib.rs, as that's where the new function is defined. The test will be named uniquely to avoid conflicts.

Finally, I'll structure the test according to the given example, ensuring it's concise and directly tests the new functionality.

<Filename>glean-core/rlb/src/lib.rs</Filename>
<imports>
use super::set_experimentation_id;
use super::test_get_experimentation_id;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_set_experimentation_id() {
    let expected_id = "test-id".to_string();
    set_experimentation_id(expected_id.clone());
    let actual_id = test_get_experimentation_id().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(expected_id, actual_id);
}</Rust>
