- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 8.91%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_local_now_with_offset_correct_timezone() {
    let now = Local::now();
    let fixed_now = local_now_with_offset();
    assert_eq!(now.timestamp(), fixed_now.timestamp());
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
