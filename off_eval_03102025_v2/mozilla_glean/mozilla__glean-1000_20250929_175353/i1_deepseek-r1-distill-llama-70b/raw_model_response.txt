Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is about removing the customization of the user-agent in the PingRequest. The patch removes a comment indicating that clients may add headers like userAgent. 

So, the question is, does this change affect the behavior of the code? Before the patch, the code allowed adding custom user-agent headers, but according to the issue, it's never used. So, the functionality is being removed.

I should check if any tests relied on this customization. If tests were adding a user-agent and expecting it to be present, those tests would fail after the patch. But since the feature isn't used, maybe there are no such tests.

However, to be thorough, I should write a test that ensures the user-agent can no longer be customized. But wait, how does the PingRequest handle headers now? If the code removed the ability to set user-agent, any test trying to add it should fail.

Wait, looking at the code, the PingRequest's new function creates default headers. Before, maybe users could modify these headers, but now that the comment is removed, perhaps the API no longer allows it. Or maybe the code still allows adding headers, but the comment was just removed.

Hmm, the patch only removes the comment, not the actual code that allows adding headers. So, the functionality remains, but the documentation is updated. In that case, maybe no test is needed because the behavior hasn't changed.

But the issue suggests that the customization is never used, so perhaps the code is being cleaned up. If the code still allows adding headers, but the comment is removed, then the test might not be necessary because the behavior is the same.

Wait, perhaps the function's implementation allows headers to be added, but the comment was misleading. So, after the patch, the comment accurately reflects that you can't add headers like user-agent. Or maybe the function's implementation is being changed to disallow that.

I'm a bit confused. Let me look at the code again. The PingRequest::new function creates a new instance with certain headers. If the code allowed adding more headers before, and the patch removes that comment, perhaps the code still allows it, but the documentation is corrected.

In that case, no test is needed because the functionality hasn't changed. The test would have to check if adding a user-agent is possible, but since the code still allows it, the test would pass before and after, making it unnecessary.

Alternatively, if the code is being changed to disallow adding headers, then a test would be needed. But from the patch, it's just a comment change, so the code's behavior remains the same.

Therefore, no unit test is needed because the functionality hasn't changed. The patch only removes a comment, so the behavior before and after is the same. Hence, the test isn't required.
