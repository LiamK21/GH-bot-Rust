Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about the RLB testing API blocking on the dispatcher. The patch replaces calls to `dispatcher::block_on_queue()` with a new function `block_on_dispatcher()`, which adds an assertion to check if Glean was initialized.

First, I should understand what the patch does. The new function `block_on_dispatcher()` calls `dispatcher::block_on_queue()` but first checks if `was_initialize_called()`. If not, it panics. This is important because calling this function before Glean is initialized should now cause a panic, which wasn't the case before.

Looking at the provided test cases in the patch, there's a new test `blocking_before_init_panics()`. This test checks if accessing a metric before initialization causes a panic. It creates a metric, tries to get its value, and expects a panic with a specific message. So, this test seems to cover the scenario where the function is called before initialization.

But wait, the user is asking if a unit test is needed. Since the patch introduces a new function and changes existing behavior, a test is necessary to ensure that the panic occurs as expected. The provided test in the patch does exactly that, so I don't need to write a new test. However, I should check if this test is sufficient.

The test `blocking_before_init_panics()` does the following:
1. Acquires the test lock to prevent interference.
2. Destroys Glean to ensure it's uninitialized.
3. Creates a BooleanMetric.
4. Tries to call `test_get_value` on it, which should call `block_on_dispatcher()`.
5. Expects a panic with the message "initialize was never called".

This test should fail before the patch because `block_on_dispatcher()` didn't exist, and the old function didn't check for initialization. After the patch, it should pass because the panic is correctly triggered.

Therefore, the test is already provided in the patch, so no additional test is needed. I should return <NO> because the necessary test is already included.
