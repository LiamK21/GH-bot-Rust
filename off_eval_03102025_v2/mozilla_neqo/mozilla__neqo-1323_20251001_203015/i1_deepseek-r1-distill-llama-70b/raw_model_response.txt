Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about removing InternalErrors added in #1085, specifically replacing Error::InternalError(u16) with Error::InternalError. 

Looking at the patch, several files have changes where specific error codes (like 1, 2, etc.) are being replaced with a single InternalError variant. This suggests that the errors are being consolidated, possibly to reduce the number of error variants.

Now, to determine if a test is needed. Since this change affects error handling, a test could verify that the new InternalError is correctly returned in cases where previously a specific code was used. For example, in the function map_stream_send_atomic_error, the error used to return Error::InternalError(2), but now it returns Error::InternalError.

I should write a test that checks if the function returns the correct error type after the change. The test should fail before the patch because it expects the old error code, and pass after the patch when the error is the new variant.

The test will call map_stream_send_atomic_error with a TransportError that leads to the InternalError case. Then, it will assert that the returned error is indeed InternalError.

I need to make sure the test is self-contained, so I'll import necessary modules and define any required structs or enums. Since TransportError isn't provided, I'll create a dummy implementation for testing purposes.

Putting it all together, the test will verify that the function returns the correct error type after the patch, ensuring the behavior is as expected.
