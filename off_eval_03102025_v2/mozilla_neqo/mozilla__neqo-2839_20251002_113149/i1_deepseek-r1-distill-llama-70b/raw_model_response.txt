Okay, I need to determine whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. Let's look at the issue and the patch provided.

The issue is from OSS-Fuzz, which found a bug in the project. The patch modifies two files: `codec.rs` and `frame.rs`. In `codec.rs`, a new method `skip_while` is added to the Decoder, along with a test for it. In `frame.rs`, the Padding frame decoding logic is changed to use `skip_while`, and a new test `padding_frame_u16_overflow` is added.

The user is asking if a unit test is needed. Since the patch already includes tests in the `mod tests` block, I need to check if these tests are sufficient or if an additional test is required.

Looking at the `codec.rs` test, it tests the `skip_while` method with various scenarios, which seems thorough. In `frame.rs`, the new test `padding_frame_u16_overflow` checks for a u16 overflow condition when decoding a Padding frame. This test should fail before the patch because without the patch, the decoder might not handle the overflow correctly, leading to a successful decode instead of an error.

So, the existing tests in the patch seem to cover the necessary cases. Therefore, no additional unit test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch.
