Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is that `mio-extras` isn't compatible with `mio` 0.7, and the patch replaces it with `mio-misc`. The patch changes several parts of the code, replacing `UdpSocket` with a new `Socket` struct from `mio-misc`.

First, I need to understand what the patch does. It looks like the `neqo-client` and `neqo-server` are being updated to use `mio-misc`'s `Socket` instead of the standard `UdpSocket`. The `Datagram` struct is also being updated to work with this new socket.

Now, considering testing: The patch introduces a new `Socket` struct in `neqo-common/src/udp.rs`, which has `send` and `recv` methods. The test provided in the patch is an integration test that checks if the TOS (Type of Service) is correctly handled when sending and receiving a datagram. This test uses `tokio::test` and checks if the ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) is preserved.

But is this test sufficient? It's an integration test, which is good, but unit tests are also important. However, unit tests for network code can be tricky because they often require mocking, which might need external libraries. Since the user prefers not to use additional resources beyond the standard library, writing a unit test without mocks might be challenging.

Looking at the code, the `Socket` struct's `send` and `recv` methods are already tested in the provided integration test. This test checks the behavior before and after the patch, ensuring that the TOS is correctly handled. Since this test is already part of the patch, it covers the necessary functionality.

Therefore, I don't think an additional unit test is needed beyond what's already included. The existing test in the patch should suffice to verify the fix.
