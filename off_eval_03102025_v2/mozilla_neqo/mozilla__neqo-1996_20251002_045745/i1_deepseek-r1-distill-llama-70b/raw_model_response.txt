Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is that an `http3` QNS test is failing with quiche, specifically related to a stream type reader. The error occurs when the server tries to read a frame type and encounters an unexpected value, causing a connection error.

Looking at the patch, I see several changes. The main modifications are in handling `NewStreamType` and `HFrameType`. The patch introduces a new struct `HFrameType` which wraps a `u64`, and various functions are updated to use this struct instead of raw `u64` values. This suggests that the issue was due to incorrect handling of frame types as raw integers, leading to garbage values being read.

The patch also modifies how `NewStreamType` is handled. For example, `NewStreamType::Http` now includes a `u64` parameter, which probably represents the first frame type. This change affects how streams are created and validated, especially in the server context.

I should check if the existing tests cover these changes. The patch includes a `mod tests` block with some test cases, but I need to see if they cover the specific scenario where an unknown frame type is handled correctly.

The original issue occurred when the server received a frame type that wasn't properly validated, leading to an error. The patch adds checks to ensure that known frame types are correctly identified and that unknown ones are handled appropriately.

To verify this, a test should simulate a scenario where an unknown frame type is sent to the server. The test should check that the server correctly identifies it as an invalid frame type and returns an appropriate error.

I'll need to write a test that creates a `NewStreamType` with an unknown frame type and checks if the server handles it by returning an `Error::HttpFrame`. This will ensure that the patch correctly resolves the issue by properly validating frame types.

So, the test will set up a `NewStreamType` with a made-up frame type, process it, and assert that the result is an error. This should fail before the patch and pass after, confirming the fix.

The test will verify that unknown frame types are correctly handled as invalid, which was the root cause of the issue.
