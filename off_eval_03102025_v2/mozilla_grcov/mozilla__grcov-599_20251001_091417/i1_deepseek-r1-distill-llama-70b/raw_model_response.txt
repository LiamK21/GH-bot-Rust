Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the patch provided. The issue is about adding support for generating Cobertura XML coverage reports. The patch includes a new module `cobertura.rs` which adds the functionality. 

Looking at the patch, I see that there's already a test module included in `cobertura.rs` with two test functions: `test_cobertura()` and `test_cobertura_double_lines()`. These tests seem to cover the basic functionality and a more complex case. 

Since the patch itself includes comprehensive tests, I don't think additional unit tests are necessary. The existing tests should suffice to verify the correctness of the Cobertura output. 

Therefore, no new unit test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch.
