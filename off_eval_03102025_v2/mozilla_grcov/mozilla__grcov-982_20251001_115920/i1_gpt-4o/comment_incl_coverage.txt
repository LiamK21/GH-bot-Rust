Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 71.68% to 77.91%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_create_subpath_in_output_path() {
    let output_dir = Path::new("coverage/subpath");
    let _ = fs::remove_dir_all(output_dir);

    output_html(&[], Some(output_dir), 1, false, None);

    assert!(output_dir.exists() && output_dir.is_dir());

    let _ = fs::remove_dir_all("coverage");
}
```
