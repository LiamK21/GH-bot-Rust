Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 71.68% to 77.90%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_output_html_creates_subdirectories() {
    let temp_dir = PathBuf::from("test_output");
    let results = Vec::new();

    // Clean up any existing test directory
    if temp_dir.exists() {
        fs::remove_dir_all(&temp_dir).unwrap();
    }

    // Test with a subdirectory that doesn't exist
    let output_path = temp_dir.join("subdir");
    output_html(&results, Some(output_path.as_path()), 1, false, None);

    // Verify the directories were created
    assert!(output_path.exists());
    fs::remove_dir_all(&temp_dir).unwrap();
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/output.rs` file before running it.
