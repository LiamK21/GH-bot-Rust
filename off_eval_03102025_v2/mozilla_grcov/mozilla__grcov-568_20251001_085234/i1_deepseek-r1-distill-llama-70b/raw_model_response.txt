Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch and, if so, write that test. Let's start by understanding the issue and the patch.

The issue is to remove the `check_gcov_version` function because it's no longer used anywhere. The patch provided removes this function from `src/gcov.rs`. It also removes the associated tests for this function, which were present in the `mod tests` block.

Now, the question is: do we need a unit test for this change? Since the function is being removed, any existing tests for it should also be removed. But in this case, the patch already removes the tests, so I don't need to add any new tests for `check_gcov_version`.

Wait, but the user is asking whether a unit test is needed. Since the function is removed, there's nothing left to test. The tests that were there are already gone. So, no new test is required because the function doesn't exist anymore. Therefore, the answer should be NO.
