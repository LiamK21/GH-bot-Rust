Okay, so I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. Let me start by understanding the issue and the changes made.

The issue is about splitting all metrics into average and sum. Previously, some metrics were only calculated as sums, and now they need both average and sum. The patch modifies the `nom.rs` file, adding new fields like `functions_average`, `closures_average`, and `average` to the `Stats` struct. It also updates the `serialize` method to include these new fields and adds `space_count` to track the number of spaces for calculating averages.

Looking at the patch, I see that several tests are already present in the `nom.rs` file. These tests are checking the new average calculations. For example, there are tests that verify `functions_average`, `closures_average`, and `average` with different inputs. Each test case seems to cover various scenarios, like different numbers of spaces and varying counts of functions and closures.

Since the patch includes comprehensive tests within the `mod tests` block, it seems that the developers have already written unit tests to cover the changes. These tests likely fail before the patch is applied because the new average fields aren't present, and after the patch, they should pass as the averages are correctly calculated.

Therefore, I don't think an additional unit test is needed beyond what's already included in the patch. The existing tests should suffice to verify the correctness of the changes.
