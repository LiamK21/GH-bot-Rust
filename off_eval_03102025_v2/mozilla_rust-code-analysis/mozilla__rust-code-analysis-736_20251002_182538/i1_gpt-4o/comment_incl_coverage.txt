Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 82.71% to 83.63%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_functions_and_closures_average() {
    let mut stats = Stats::default();
    stats.space_count = 4;
    stats.functions_sum = 3;
    stats.closures_sum = 1;

    let expected_functions_average = 0.75;
    let expected_closures_average = 0.25;
    let expected_average = 1.0;

    let actual_functions_average = stats.functions_average();
    let actual_closures_average = stats.closures_average();
    let actual_average = stats.average();

    assert_eq!(expected_functions_average, actual_functions_average);
    assert_eq!(expected_closures_average, actual_closures_average);
    assert_eq!(expected_average, actual_average);
}
```
