Okay, I need to figure out how to write a regression test for the patch provided. The issue is about calculating min and max for all metrics, specifically for Nexits. The patch modifies the `exit.rs` file to include min, max, and sum for Nexits.

First, I should check if there's already a test for Nexits. Looking at the patch, I see that in `exit.rs`, there are existing tests, but they were modified to include the new fields. So, the existing tests now check for `exit_sum`, `exit_min`, and `exit_max`. 

But to ensure that the patch works correctly, I need a new test that specifically verifies that min and max are calculated properly. The test should fail before the patch and pass after.

I'll create a test that adds two Nexits values and checks if the min and max are correct. I'll use `Stats` struct, set some values, merge them, and then compute minmax. Then, I'll compare the expected min and max with the actual values.

I'll name the test `test_nexits_min_max` to avoid conflicts with existing tests. I'll import the necessary modules, create instances of `Stats`, merge them, call `compute_minmax`, and assert the results.

So, the test will initialize two `Stats` instances with different exit values, merge them, and then check if the min and max are as expected. This should ensure that the patch correctly calculates these metrics.

The patch adds min and max calculations for the Nexits metric, so a test is needed to verify this functionality. The test will ensure that the Nexits metric correctly calculates min and max values before and after the patch.

#[test]
fn test_nexits_min_max() {
    let mut stats1 = Stats::default();
    stats1.exit = 5;
    let mut stats2 = Stats::default();
    stats2.exit = 3;
    
    stats1.merge(&stats2);
    stats1.compute_minmax();
    
    let expected_min = 3;
    let expected_max = 5;
    
    assert_eq!(stats1.exit_min(), expected_min as f64);
    assert_eq!(stats1.exit_max(), expected_max as f64);
}
