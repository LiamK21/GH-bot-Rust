Okay, so I need to figure out how to write a regression test for this issue. The problem is that when analyzing a C++ file, the tool isn't correctly identifying the name of class member functions, especially when they have the namespace or class qualifier. For example, the function `CuiConfigFunctionListBox::ClearAll()` is showing up as `null` for the name.

Looking at the patch provided, it seems like the changes are in the `getter.rs` and `spaces.rs` files. In `getter.rs`, they're adding more token types to the match statement, which probably allows the parser to handle qualified identifiers. Then in `spaces.rs`, they added a test that checks if the function name is correctly parsed as `"Foo::bar"`.

So, the test in the patch is `c_scope_resolution_operator`, which uses `check_func_space` to verify that the function name is correctly extracted. But I think we need another test to cover the specific case where the function has a namespace, like `CuiConfigFunctionListBox::ClearAll()`.

I should write a test that provides a code snippet with such a function and checks if the name is correctly parsed. The test should fail before the patch because the name would be null, and pass after the patch because the name would be correctly set.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create a test function, maybe `test_class_member_function_name`, which uses `check_func_space` to parse a sample code.
2. The sample code should include a class with a member function, like `void MyClass::myFunction() {}`.
3. In the test, after parsing, check that the function's name is `"MyClass::myFunction"`.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external libraries beyond what's already in the project. Also, I should import only the necessary functions, like `check_func_space` and `CppParser`.

Wait, looking at the existing test in the patch, it uses `check_func_space` with `CppParser`. So I can follow the same structure. I'll write a test that uses a similar setup but with a different function name to ensure the parser correctly handles the qualified name.

I should also ensure that the test name is unique and doesn't conflict with existing tests. Since the patch already has `c_scope_resolution_operator`, I'll name mine something like `test_class_member_function_name`.

Putting it all together, the test will have the code snippet, call `check_func_space`, and assert that the function's name is correctly set. This should validate that the patch fixes the issue.

To verify that the patch correctly resolves the issue where class member function names with namespaces were not being identified, we need a test that checks if the function name is properly extracted after the patch.
