Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Replace tree-sitter submodules with Rust bindings
Some of the `tree-sitter` grammars can be used as `Cargo.toml` dependencies. In this way, some submodules can be removed.

Pros
- A cleaner repository
- Avoid breaks during the update of a tree-sitter grammar due to some problems in handling submodules
- Less options and commands to clone the project

Cons 
- Impossibility to change the grammars directly in this repo, the grammars have to be modified upstream


Submodules languages:

- [x] tree-sitter-java (#449)
- [x] tree-sitter-python (#464)
- [x] tree-sitter-cpp (#498)
- [x] tree-sitter-rust (#594)
- [x] tree-sitter-javascript (#463)
- [x] tree-sitter-typescript (#592)

Function signatures
<Signatures>

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at rust-code-analysis and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed or you believe you need additional testing resources beyond the Rust standard library (e.g., mocking libraries) to write a useful unit test, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
If the file you are adding the test already contains a test in the <patch>, ensure that the test name is unique.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
