Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if I need to write a regression test for the given patch. The patch removes the `collect_string` function from `PingMaker`. Since this is a breaking change, removing a public function, any code that was using `collect_string` will now fail to compile or run. 

First, I need to determine if there are any existing tests that rely on `collect_string`. If there are, those tests will start failing after the patch is applied. But looking at the issue, it seems that `collect_string` is unused, so maybe there are no tests using it. 

Wait, but the user is asking if a unit test is needed. Since the function is being removed, perhaps the test is to ensure that the function is indeed no longer available. But that's more of a compile-time check, which isn't typically handled by unit tests. 

Alternatively, maybe the test is needed to ensure that the removal doesn't affect other parts of the code. But since `collect_string` was unused, its removal shouldn't impact other functionalities. 

I think in this case, no unit test is necessary because the function was unused, so there's no behavior to test. Removing it doesn't change the functionality of the codebase. Therefore, the answer is <NO>.
