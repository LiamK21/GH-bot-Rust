Okay, so I need to figure out if a unit test is needed for the given patch and then write that test if necessary. Let me start by understanding the issue and the patch.

The issue is about upgrading glean-parser to version 8.1.0. The patch provided changes the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION constant from "8.0.0" to "8.1.0" in the file glean-core/build/src/lib.rs. 

Now, I need to determine if a unit test is required. Since the patch is a version bump, the main concern is whether this change affects any functionality that can be tested. If the new version introduces breaking changes or new features, tests might be necessary to ensure compatibility.

Looking at the code, the constant is used in the Builder struct, which is a Rust bindings generator for Glean. The version change could affect how the parser is used or how data is processed. 

I should check if there are any existing tests that might fail after this change. If the existing tests assume the old version's behavior, they might start failing. Alternatively, if the new version has different behavior, new tests might be needed to cover that.

Since the patch only changes the version string, perhaps the immediate effect is on the version used during the build process. A test could verify that the correct version is being used. For example, a test that checks the value of GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION.

But wait, is that necessary? The constant is straightforward, so maybe a simple test can assert its value. However, if the version is used in a way that affects the generated code, perhaps more extensive tests are needed. But without more context on how the version is used beyond being a constant, a simple test might suffice.

So, I think a unit test is needed to ensure that the version has been correctly updated. The test will fail before the patch because the version was 8.0.0, and after the patch, it should be 8.1.0.

Now, how to write this test. The test function should be named something like test_glean_parser_version. It will import the constant and assert that it equals "8.1.0".

I need to make sure the imports are correct. Since the constant is in the same file, I can use super::GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION. 

Putting it all together, the test will look like this: it will compare the current value of GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION with the expected "8.1.0" and panic if it doesn't match.

I should also ensure that this test is placed in the correct file, which is glean-core/build/src/lib.rs. Since the test is self-contained and only checks the version, it doesn't require any additional dependencies beyond what's already in the standard library.

So, the final test will be a simple unit test that checks the value of GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION after the patch is applied. This will ensure that the upgrade was successful.

The patch upgrades the Glean parser version, so a test is needed to verify the version is correctly set to 8.1.0.

<glean-core/build/src/lib.rs>
<imports>
use super::GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_glean_parser_version() {
    assert_eq!(GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, "8.1.0");
}</Rust>
