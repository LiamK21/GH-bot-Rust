Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 84.62%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_record_coverage() {
  let temp_file = NamedTempFile::new().unwrap();
  env::set_var("GLEAN_TEST_COVERAGE", temp_file.path());
  let metric_id = "test_metric_id";
  record_coverage(metric_id);
  let mut contents = String::new();
  File::open(temp_file.path()).unwrap().read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(contents.trim(), metric_id);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/coverage.rs` file before running it.
