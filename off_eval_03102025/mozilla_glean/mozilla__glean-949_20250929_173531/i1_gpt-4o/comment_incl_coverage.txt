Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 30.97%.

```rust
#[test]

    let valid_labels = vec![
        "valid_label",

        "v1",
        "v1.valid_label",
        "v1.valid_label.valid_label",

    let invalid_labels = vec![
