Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 100.00%.

```rust
use super::spawn;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;
#[test]
fn test_thread_registration_and_unregistration() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let counter_clone = Arc::clone(&counter);

    let handle = spawn("test_thread", move || {
        let mut num = counter_clone.lock().unwrap();
        *num += 1;
    }).expect("Failed to spawn thread");

    handle.join().expect("Thread panicked");

    let result = *counter.lock().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(result, 1);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/thread.rs` file before running it.
