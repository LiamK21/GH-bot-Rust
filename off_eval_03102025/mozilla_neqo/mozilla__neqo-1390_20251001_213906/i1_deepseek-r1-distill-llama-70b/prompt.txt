Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Properly check validity of a session ID
**The spec says:**
> If at any point a session ID is received that cannot a valid ID for a
   client-initiated bidirectional stream, the recepient MUST close the
   connection with an H3_ID_ERROR error code.If at any point a session ID is received that cannot a valid ID for a
   client-initiated bidirectional stream, the recepient MUST close the
   connection with an H3_ID_ERROR error code.

**Our current implementation behaves as follows:**
When a WebTransprot stream is received with a session id, we check if we have a session with the ID that is active. If we do not we close the steam with the HttpStreamCreation error ([this code](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/blob/e71e860489447fed25b64bd8ec31a804dccb0dad/neqo-http3/src/connection.rs#L492-L495v)). We do not check id session ID is a  valid stream ID for client-initiated streams.
An invalid session ID will not have a session registered therefore the stream will be closed. The spec foresees that the connection will be closed with an H3_ID_ERROR error.

**What we need to do:**
- check if the session ID is a valid client-initiated stream id. We should also check stream limits, i.e. that we do not receive an ID that is a **valid** valid client-initiated stream id, but it is higher than the allowed stream ID.
- for the later check use the [is_stream_id_allowed](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/blob/4c314c1a58eb017a3a239d640cd505490fa36611/neqo-transport/src/connection/mod.rs#L2306) function.

Function signatures

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at neqo and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed or you believe you need additional testing resources beyond the Rust standard library (e.g., mocking libraries) to write a useful unit test, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
If the file you are adding the test already contains a test in the <patch>, ensure that the test name is unique.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
