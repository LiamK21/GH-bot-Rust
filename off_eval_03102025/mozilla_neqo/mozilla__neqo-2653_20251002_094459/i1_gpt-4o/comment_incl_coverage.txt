Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 92.48% to 93.95%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_encoder_write_str() {
    let mut encoder = Encoder::new();
    let input_str = "test string";
    let expected = input_str.as_bytes().to_vec();

    write!(encoder, "{}", input_str).expect("write should succeed");

    assert_eq!(encoder.as_ref(), expected);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `neqo-common/src/codec.rs` file before running it.
