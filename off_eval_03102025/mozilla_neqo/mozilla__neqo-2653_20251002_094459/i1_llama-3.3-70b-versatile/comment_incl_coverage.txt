Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 92.48% to 93.96%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_encoder_write() {
  let mut encoder = Encoder::new();
  let input_str = "test_string";
  let expected_bytes = input_str.as_bytes();
  encoder.write_str(input_str).unwrap();
  let actual_bytes: Vec<u8> = encoder.into();
  assert_eq!(actual_bytes, expected_bytes);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `neqo-common/src/codec.rs` file before running it.
