Alright, I need to determine whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is about treating response code 101 as an error and resetting the stream. The patch modifies two files: connection_client.rs and headers_checks.rs.

Looking at the patch, I see that in headers_checks.rs, the is_interim function now returns an error if the status code is 101. Previously, it treated all 1xx codes as interim, but now 101 is specifically treated as an error. In connection_client.rs, a new test function response_w_101 has been added. This test sends a 101 response and checks if the stream is reset with the correct error.

I should check if this new test is sufficient or if another test is needed. The test in the patch seems to cover the scenario where a 101 response is sent, and the client resets the stream. It verifies that the event is a reset with the correct error code.

Since the patch already includes a test that directly addresses the issue, I don't think an additional unit test is necessary. The existing test should fail before the patch because without the changes, the 101 response wouldn't trigger a reset. After the patch, the test should pass as the stream is reset correctly.

Therefore, no additional test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch.
