Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about adding checks for WebTransport request headers on the server side. The patch modifies the headers_valid function to include checks for :protocol, :scheme, :authority, and :path when the method is CONNECT and the protocol is webtransport.

Looking at the patch, I see that they added several tests in the mod tests block. These tests include checking for missing headers, invalid schemes, and a valid webtransport connect. So, they've already written tests that should cover the new functionality.

The user is asking if I need to write an additional test. Since the patch includes tests that should fail before the changes and pass after, I don't need to add more. The existing tests are comprehensive enough.

Therefore, the answer is NO because the necessary tests are already included in the patch.
