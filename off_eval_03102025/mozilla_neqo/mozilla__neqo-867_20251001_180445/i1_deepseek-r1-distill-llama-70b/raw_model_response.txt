Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about a bug where receiving new bytes that overlap the end of existing bytes could cause data loss or crashes. The patch modifies the `recv_stream.rs` file, specifically the `RxStreamOrderer` implementation.

Looking at the patch, I see that the `truncate_to` variable was changed from `new_data.len() - overlap as usize` to `prev_vec.len() - overlap as usize`. This suggests that the truncation was incorrectly based on the new data before, which could cause the loss of existing bytes or crashes when the new data was shorter than the overlap.

Now, I check the tests provided in the patch. There are several test functions added, like `recv_overlap_start`, `recv_overlap_end`, and `recv_overlap_complete`. These tests cover various scenarios where the received ranges overlap with existing data, ensuring that the truncation works correctly without losing data or crashing.

Since the patch already includes comprehensive tests that specifically target the fixed issue, I don't think an additional unit test is necessary. The existing tests should sufficiently cover the scenarios where the bug would manifest, both before and after the patch.

Therefore, I conclude that no new test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch.
