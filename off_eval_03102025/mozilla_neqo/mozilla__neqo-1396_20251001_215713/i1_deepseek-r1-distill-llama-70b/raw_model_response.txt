Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a regression test for the given patch. Let me start by understanding the issue.

The user encountered a build error when compiling neqo_glue with version v0.6.2. The error message says that module `features` is private. Looking at the code, in lib.rs, the module `features` was declared as `mod features;`, which makes it private by default. The patch changes it to `pub mod features;`, making it publicly accessible.

So, the problem was that another crate, neqo_glue, was trying to use the `features` module from neqo-http3 but couldn't because it was private. After the patch, it's public, so the error should be resolved.

Now, I need to determine if a unit test is needed. Since this is a visibility change, a test can verify that the module is indeed accessible after the patch. Without the test, we might not catch if the module becomes private again in the future.

The next step is to write the test. The test should check that the `features` module can be accessed publicly. I can create a test function that tries to import and use something from `features`.

I should structure the test as follows: import the necessary items from `features`, and then try to use them. If the module is public, the test will compile and run; otherwise, it will fail.

I'll name the test `test_features_module_is_public` to clearly describe its purpose. In the test, I'll try to use `features::extended_connect::SessionCloseReason` to ensure it's accessible.

I also need to make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external libraries beyond the standard. Since this is a visibility test, it should be straightforward.

Finally, I'll write the test code, ensuring that all imports are correctly specified and that the test function is properly annotated with `#[test]`.

<Filename>neqo-http3/src/lib.rs</Filename>
<imports>
use super::features::extended_connect::SessionCloseReason;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_features_module_is_public() {
    let _ = SessionCloseReason;
}
</Rust>
