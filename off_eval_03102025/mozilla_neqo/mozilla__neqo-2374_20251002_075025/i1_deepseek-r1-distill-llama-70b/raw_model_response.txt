Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about updating the ACK_FREQUENCY handling according to the draft. The patch modifies several files, including ackrate.rs, connection/mod.rs, frame.rs, and others. 

Looking at the changes, the ack_freq function in AckRate now uses ack_eliciting_threshold and reordering_threshold instead of tolerance and ignore_order. The default reordering_threshold is set to 1, which means that out-of-order packets will elicit an immediate ACK if the threshold is met. 

I should check if there are existing tests that cover these changes. The patch includes some test cases in the mod tests block, but I'm not sure if they cover all scenarios. For example, the new reordering_threshold behavior might not be fully tested.

Since the patch changes the default behavior, a test that verifies this new default is necessary. The test should check if, without any ACK_FREQUENCY frames, the reordering_threshold is 1 and that out-of-order packets trigger an immediate ACK.

I'll write a test that creates a RecvdPackets instance, sets some received packets out of order, and checks if an ACK is generated immediately. This will ensure that the default behavior is correctly implemented after the patch.

I need to make sure the test fails before the patch and passes after. So, I'll structure the test to reflect the expected behavior based on the new defaults.

    // Receive packets out of order to trigger immediate ACK.
    rp.set_received(now, 1, true);
    rp.set_received(now, 3, true);
    
    // Since reordering_threshold is 1, this should elicit an immediate ACK.
    assert!(rp.ack_time().is_some());
