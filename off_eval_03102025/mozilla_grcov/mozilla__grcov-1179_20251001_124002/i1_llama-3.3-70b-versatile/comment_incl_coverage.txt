Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 33.33% to 38.89%.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_parse_version_with_carriage_return() {
  let gcov_output = "gcov (GCC) 12.2.0\r";
  let expected_version = Version::new(12, 2, 0);
  let actual_version = parse_version(gcov_output);
  assert_eq!(actual_version, expected_version);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/gcov.rs` file before running it.
