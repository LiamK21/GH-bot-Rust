Okay, so I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The patch adds a new Markdown output feature to the tool. Let me look at the changes.

First, the patch modifies the `OutputType` enum to include `Markdown`. That means the tool can now generate Markdown-formatted output. Then, in `main.rs`, they added a case for `OutputType::Markdown` which calls `output_markdown`.

Looking at the `output.rs` file, they added a new function `output_markdown`. This function generates a summary of coverage in Markdown format. It includes a table with file names, coverage percentages, covered lines, and missed lines. Also, there's a test already in the patch, `test_markdown()`, which tests this functionality.

The test creates a temporary file, generates Markdown output, reads it back, and compares it to an expected string. It checks both the table structure and the total coverage. This test should fail before the patch because the `output_markdown` function didn't exist, so the code would compile but the test would fail. After the patch, the function is implemented, so the test should pass.

Since the patch already includes a test, I don't need to write another one. The existing test covers the functionality, so no additional test is necessary.
