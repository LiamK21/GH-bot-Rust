Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Issue:
<issue>
Stop depending on env_logger
Glean as a library should probably not initialize `env_logger`.
The application around it should be responsible for it.

For Android, iOS and Python we handle logging setup already through other crates/methods.

Function signatures
<Signatures>
fn glean_enable_logging() -> ()
</Signatures>

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block.
 Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
- name
- parameters
- Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
