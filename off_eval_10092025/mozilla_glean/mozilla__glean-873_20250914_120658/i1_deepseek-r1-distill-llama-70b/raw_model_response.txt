Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The patch logs the Glean version at initialization and updates the version string in a few places. 

First, I'll look at the changes. The patch adds a const GLEAN_VERSION using env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION") and replaces instances where the version was previously fetched with this const. 

Now, considering whether a test is needed. Since this change affects logging and headers, but not the core functionality, maybe a unit test isn't necessary. However, it's good practice to ensure that the version is correctly logged and included in the headers. 

Wait, but unit tests usually test behavior that can be asserted programmatically. In this case, checking log messages might require more of an integration test or checking logs, which can be tricky in unit tests. 

Alternatively, maybe the test can verify that the version is correctly set in the headers or client info. For example, in the PingRequest, the X-Client-Version header is set using GLEAN_VERSION. So a test could create a PingRequest and check that the header contains the correct version. 

But looking at the provided functions, I don't see any public functions that expose the version. The log statement is in the info macro, which might not be easily testable without mocking or capturing logs, which is more complex. 

So, perhaps a unit test isn't straightforward here. The changes are more about correct usage of a constant rather than introducing new functionality. 

Therefore, maybe no unit test is needed because the changes are simple replacements and don't introduce new behavior that can be tested in isolation. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says to write a test if needed. Since the patch replaces multiple instances of env! with a const, maybe a test can check that the version is consistent across these uses. 

Alternatively, since the version is a const, any usage should automatically have the correct value, so maybe no test is required. 

I think in this case, a unit test isn't necessary because the changes are more about code organization and using a const, which is a compile-time check. The functionality remains the same, just with the version fetched once. So, no test is needed.
