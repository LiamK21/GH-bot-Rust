Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided an issue where running `mach bootstrap` on an arm64 Ubuntu 22.04 system fails due to an undefined symbol in the Glean library. The error message points to `libglean_ffi.so` missing the symbol `uniffi_glean_ffi_fn_clone_booleanmetric`.

Looking at the patch provided, it's in `tools/embedded-uniffi-bindgen/src/lib.rs`, and it's just an empty file added to suppress a warning. Hmm, that doesn't seem directly related to the missing symbol. Maybe the issue is with how the Uniffi bindings are being generated.

I remember that Uniffi is used for generating FFI bindings between Rust and other languages. If a symbol is missing, perhaps the bindings aren't being generated correctly for the arm64 architecture. So, the problem might be that the Uniffi code isn't properly handling this architecture, leading to the missing symbol.

The user is asking whether a unit test is needed. Since the patch is minimal, just adding an empty file, I don't think it directly fixes the issue. So, maybe more changes are needed, but for now, I need to assess if a test is required based on the given patch.

Wait, the patch is just adding an empty file to suppress a warning. That might not affect the functionality. So, perhaps the real issue lies elsewhere, and this patch isn't the solution. Therefore, maybe no test is needed because the patch doesn't address the root cause of the problem.

But the user is asking if a unit test is needed for this specific patch. Since the patch doesn't change any functionality, just adds an empty file, I don't think a test is necessary. The test would not fail before or pass after because the patch doesn't alter any behavior related to the missing symbol.

So, after considering all this, I conclude that no test is needed for this patch. The issue with the missing symbol remains unresolved, and the patch doesn't contribute to fixing it. Therefore, the answer is <NO>.
