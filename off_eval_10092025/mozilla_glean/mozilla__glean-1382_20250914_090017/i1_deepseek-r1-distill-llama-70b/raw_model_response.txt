Okay, I need to determine whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The patch removes docstrings from several trait implementations in the RLB. The issue mentions that rustdoc will automatically use the trait's docstring if the implementation doesn't have one, so removing these docstrings reduces duplication.

First, I should check if any of these changes could affect the functionality of the code. Since the patch only removes comments, the actual code functionality remains unchanged. The methods' implementations are the same before and after the patch.

However, I should consider if any tests rely on the presence of these docstrings. But in Rust, docstrings are primarily for documentation and don't affect the code's behavior. So, existing tests should still pass because the code's functionality hasn't changed.

But wait, the user is asking if a regression test is needed. Regression tests are meant to catch unintended changes in functionality. Since the patch doesn't change any code behavior, a regression test might not be necessary. The tests that were passing before should still pass after the patch.

But to be thorough, maybe I should think about any possible edge cases. For example, if any tests were parsing docstrings, but that's unlikely. Most tests would be checking the method's behavior, not their documentation.

So, considering all this, I don't think a unit test is needed because the patch doesn't alter the code's functionality. Therefore, the answer should be <NO>.
