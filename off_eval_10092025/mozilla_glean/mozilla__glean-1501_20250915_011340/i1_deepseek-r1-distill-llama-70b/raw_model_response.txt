Okay, I need to determine whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is about updating the Kotlin API docs for the Timing Distribution to explain that multiple simultaneous `start` calls are allowed, each generating a unique TimerId. 

Looking at the patch, the changes are in the documentation comments. The function `set_start` now has a comment saying multiple timers can run simultaneously. The trait `TimingDistribution` also has a similar comment. So the patch is about documentation, not changing the code's functionality.

Since the patch doesn't alter any code behavior, existing tests should still pass. There's no new functionality to test because the code isn't changing how it handles multiple starts. The documentation just clarifies the existing behavior.

Therefore, a unit test isn't needed because the code's functionality hasn't changed. The test would fail to catch anything new since the behavior remains the same before and after the patch.
