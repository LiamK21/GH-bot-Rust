Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is required for the given patch. Let me start by understanding what the patch does.

The patch is about unblocking the RLB dispatcher. From the code changes, I see that a new function `glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher()` has been added. This function tries to detect the RLB and, if found, instructs it to flush the dispatcher. The goal is to allow using both RLB and other language bindings in the same application.

Now, considering testing. The function `glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher` is a C API function, so it's part of the FFI. Testing this function would involve checking if it correctly flushes the RLB dispatcher when it's available.

But wait, in the provided code, the RLB's `rlb_flush_dispatcher` is only called if the symbol is found. So, in a test scenario, without the RLB loaded, the function should log a message and do nothing. With the RLB, it should call the flush.

However, writing a unit test for this might be tricky because it depends on the presence of the RLB symbol at runtime. In a standard test setup without the RLB, the test would just check that the function doesn't crash and logs appropriately. But to fully verify the behavior when RLB is present, we might need an integration test rather than a unit test.

Given that the patch introduces new functionality, some form of testing is needed. But since the function's behavior depends on external factors (presence of RLB), a unit test might not be sufficient. It might require a test that can load the RLB library dynamically, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be tested in a way that mocks the presence of the RLB symbol. But that would require platform-specific code and might not be feasible in a standard Rust test.

Considering all this, I think that while testing is important, a unit test might not be the most effective way here. The function's behavior is more about interacting with an external library, which is better tested in an integration or end-to-end test setup.

So, after evaluating, I conclude that a unit test isn't necessary because the functionality depends on external factors that can't be easily mocked in a unit test. Therefore, the answer is NO.
