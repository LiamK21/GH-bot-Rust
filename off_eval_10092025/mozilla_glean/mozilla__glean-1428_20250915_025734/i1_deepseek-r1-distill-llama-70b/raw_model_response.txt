Okay, I need to determine whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The patch adds a metric to track IO errors when writing ping files. The user provided a test in the patch already, but I should verify if it's sufficient or if another test is needed.

Looking at the patch, the test `records_io_errors` is added. It checks if the IO error is recorded correctly by making the directory read-only and trying to submit a ping. The test expects the metric `io_errors` to increment by 1 when an error occurs.

I should check if this test covers the scenario before and after the patch. Before the patch, the metric didn't exist, so the test would fail because the metric wouldn't be present. After the patch, the test should pass as the metric is correctly incremented.

The test seems comprehensive as it sets up the environment, induces an error, checks the metric, and cleans up. Therefore, no additional test is needed beyond what's already provided in the patch.

So, the answer is to return <NO> since the necessary test is already included.
