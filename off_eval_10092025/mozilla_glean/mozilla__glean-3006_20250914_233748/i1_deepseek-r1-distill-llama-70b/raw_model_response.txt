Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided a patch that updates the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION from "15.2.0" to "16.1.0" in the glean-core/build/src/lib.rs file. My task is to determine if a unit test is needed and, if so, write exactly one Rust test that fails before the patch and passes after.

First, I need to understand what this patch does. It looks like it's updating the version of the Glean parser that the Builder struct uses. The Builder is responsible for generating Rust bindings, so changing the parser version might affect how the bindings are generated.

Now, I should think about whether this change could introduce any issues. If the new parser version behaves differently, it might cause the generated code to be incorrect or incompatible. Therefore, a test is necessary to ensure that the Builder correctly uses the new parser version and that the generated bindings are as expected.

The next step is to plan the test. The test should check that the Builder uses the correct GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION. Since the version is a constant, the test can directly access it and assert its value.

I should write a test function that compares the expected version with the actual version. Before the patch, the version is "15.2.0", so the test should fail because it expects "16.1.0". After applying the patch, the test should pass.

I also need to make sure the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external modules beyond what's necessary. The test will be in the same file as the Builder struct, so I can directly import it.

Putting it all together, the test will look like this: it will use the Builder struct, get the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, and assert that it's equal to "16.1.0". This ensures that the patch correctly updates the version.
</think>

The patch updates the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION constant, so a test is needed to verify this change. The test will check that the version is correctly set to "16.1.0".
