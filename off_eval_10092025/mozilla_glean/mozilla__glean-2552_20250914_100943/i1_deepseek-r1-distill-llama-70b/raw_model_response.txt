Okay, so I need to figure out if a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The patch is upgrading the glean-parser version from 8.0.0 to 8.1.0 in the glean-core/build/src/lib.rs file. 

First, I should understand what this change means. The GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION constant is being updated, which probably affects how the parser is used elsewhere in the code. If the new version introduces changes that could break existing functionality, a test is definitely needed. 

Looking at the patch, it's a simple version bump. However, without knowing the specifics of what's changed in glean-parser v8.1.0, I have to assume that there might be breaking changes or new features. Since the user is asking for a regression test, the test should ensure that after the upgrade, the system behaves as expected.

I should check if there are any functions or structs that depend on this version. If the Builder struct or any other parts of the codebase use this version to generate bindings or parse data, then a test that verifies the correct version is being used would be appropriate.

So, the test should probably check that the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION is set to "8.1.0" after the patch. This way, if someone reverts the change, the test will fail, ensuring that the correct version is used.

I need to write a test function that asserts the version is correct. Since the function is simple, the test should be straightforward. I'll name it test_glean_parser_version to clearly state its purpose.

I should also make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on external modules unless necessary. The function under test is a constant, so the test can directly access it.

Putting it all together, the test will compare the expected version string with the actual value of GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION. If they match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure the test according to the user's instructions, ensuring all imports are correctly placed and the test is concise.

<Filename> glean-core/build/src/lib.rs </Filename>
<imports>
use super::GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_glean_parser_version() {
    let expected_version = "8.1.0";
    let actual_version = GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION;
    assert_eq!(expected_version, actual_version);
