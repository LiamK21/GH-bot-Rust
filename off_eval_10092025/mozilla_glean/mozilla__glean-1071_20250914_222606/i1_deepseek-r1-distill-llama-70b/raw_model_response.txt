Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is that the `get_upload_task` function's doc comment refers to a removed `log_pings` parameter. From the patch, I see that the doc comments under "Arguments" and "log_ping" have been removed. So, the problem was that the documentation was outdated, mentioning a parameter that no longer exists.

Since the patch only removes the doc comments and doesn't change the function's behavior, the function's functionality remains the same. Therefore, the behavior before and after the patch should be identical. There's no change in how the function operates, just the documentation is corrected.

Because there's no functional change, there's no need for a unit test. Unit tests are for verifying that code behaves as expected, especially when functionality changes. In this case, since only documentation was fixed, the test isn't needed. So, the answer is NO.
