Alright, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch and, if so, write the appropriate test. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The issue is a build error when compiling neqo_glue with version v0.6.2. The error message says that the module `features` is private. Looking at the code, the error points to line 11 in `lib.rs` where `features::extended_connect::SessionCloseReason` is used. The module `features` is defined in `neqo-http3/src/lib.rs` at line 146, and it's currently not public.

The patch provided changes `mod features;` to `pub mod features;`, making the module public. This should allow other crates, like neqo_glue, to access it without causing a private module error.

Now, do we need a test for this change? Since the issue is about visibility, a test that checks whether the module can be accessed publicly would be appropriate. Without a test, we might not catch regressions if someone changes the visibility back.

The test should verify that after the patch, the `features` module is accessible. One way to do this is to try to import and use a public item from `features` in another crate. If the test can access it without errors, the patch is correct.

I'll structure the test as follows:
1. Use `neqo_http3::features::extended_connect::SessionCloseReason` to ensure it's publicly accessible.
2. The test function will simply attempt to use this item. If it compiles and runs without errors, the test passes.

I need to make sure that the test is self-contained and only tests the visibility. So, the test will be in a separate crate, perhaps in `tests/visibility_test.rs`, and it will depend on `neqo_http3`.

Putting it all together, the test will import the necessary item and try to use it. If it works, the test passes, confirming that the module is public.

To verify that the `features` module is publicly accessible after the patch, we'll write a test that attempts to use it.

<Filename> tests/visibility_test.rs </Filename>
<imports>
use neqo_http3::features::extended_connect::SessionCloseReason;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_features_module_visibility() {
    let _ = SessionCloseReason;
}
</Rust>
