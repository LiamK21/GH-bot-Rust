Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. Let's look at the issue and the patch provided.

The issue is "Retry -- client role". The patch modifies the `connection.rs` file. Specifically, it adds a logging statement when a valid Retry packet is received but not handled yet. So, the code now logs a message when this situation occurs.

Now, the question is: does this change require a unit test? Well, the patch adds a log statement but doesn't change any functionality. It's more about logging than behavior. Since the functionality hasn't changed, the existing tests should still pass as the behavior remains the same. 

If I were to write a test for this, it would probably check for the presence of the log message. But unit tests typically focus on functionality rather than logging. Moreover, adding a test for a log statement might not be necessary unless the logging is critical for debugging, which is more of an integration test concern.

Therefore, since the patch doesn't alter the behavior that existing tests are checking, and the addition is just a log message, a unit test isn't required here. The answer should be NO.
