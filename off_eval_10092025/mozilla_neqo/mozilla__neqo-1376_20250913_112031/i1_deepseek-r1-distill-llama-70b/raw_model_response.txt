Okay, I need to figure out whether unit tests are necessary for the given patch. The issue is about removing two methods, set_sendorder and set_fairness, from the HTTP/3 SendStream because Clippy thinks they're unused. The patch provided removes some allow attributes related to Clippy lints from several files.

First, I should understand what the patch is doing. It looks like the patch is removing the #[allow(unknown_lints, deref_nullptr)] attributes from three different Rust files: p11.rs, prio.rs, and ssl.rs. These attributes were probably added to suppress certain Clippy warnings until a specific issue in bindgen was fixed. Now that the issue is resolved, the attributes are no longer needed and can be safely removed.

Next, I need to determine if this change affects the functionality of the code. Since the attributes are only about suppressing warnings and not changing the code's behavior, removing them shouldn't affect how the program runs. The methods set_sendorder and set_fairness are not being called in the codebase, so their presence or absence doesn't impact the current functionality.

But wait, the user mentioned that these methods were added by @jesup. Are they used elsewhere? If they're not used, then removing them would clean up the code. However, the patch doesn't remove the methods themselves, just the allow attributes. So maybe the methods are still present but unused, which is why Clippy is flagging them.

So the issue is whether these methods can be removed without affecting the code's functionality. Since they're not used, their removal wouldn't cause any issues. However, the patch provided doesn't remove the methods; it only removes the allow attributes. Therefore, the tests should check if the methods can be removed without causing any regressions.

To write a test for this, I need to ensure that removing the methods doesn't break any existing functionality. Since the methods are not used, any test that exercises the related parts of the code should still pass after their removal.

I'll plan a test that calls into the SendStream methods, but since the methods are not used, the test might not need to directly call them. Instead, it can perform operations that would indirectly rely on the SendStream's correct behavior.

Wait, perhaps the test should check that the SendStream doesn't have these methods anymore. But that's more of a compile-time check. Alternatively, since the methods are unused, the test can be a no-op, just ensuring that the code compiles and runs without them.

Hmm, maybe the test isn't necessary because the change is purely about removing unused code and attributes. But the user's instruction says to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after, to verify the patch resolves the issue.

So, perhaps the test should check that the methods are no longer present. But that's not typical for regression tests. Alternatively, the test can verify that the code behaves as expected after the methods are removed.

I think the correct approach is to write a test that, when run before the patch, would fail because the methods are present but unused, causing Clippy warnings. After the patch, the test would pass because the warnings are gone, and the methods are removed if necessary.

Wait, but the patch only removes the allow attributes, not the methods. So the test needs to ensure that after removing the allow attributes, the code still behaves correctly. Since the attributes don't affect runtime behavior, the test should pass both before and after, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the test should check for the presence or absence of the methods. But that's more of a compile-time test, which isn't typically done in unit tests.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe the test isn't necessary because the change is about code hygiene and doesn't affect functionality. But the user's instructions say to write a test if needed.

Given that, perhaps the test is not necessary because the change doesn't affect runtime behavior. The methods are unused, so removing them or not doesn't change how the code runs. Therefore, no test is needed because there's no functional change to test.

So, the answer is <NO> because the patch doesn't change the behavior, only the code style, and thus no regression test is necessary.
