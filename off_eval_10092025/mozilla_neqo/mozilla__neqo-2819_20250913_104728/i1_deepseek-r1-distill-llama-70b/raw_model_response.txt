Okay, I need to figure out how to write a regression test for the issue where Dscp::from() doesn't cover all possible values. The problem was that before the patch, using certain values like 0b0000_1100 would cause a crash because those values weren't handled by the Dscp enum. The patch adds all the missing values as Reserved* variants, so now Dscp::from() should handle any u8 input without panicking.

So, the test needs to ensure that all possible u8 values (from 0 to 255) can be converted into a Dscp without causing an error. Before the patch, this test should fail because some values would cause the expect() call to panic. After the patch, the test should pass because all values are covered.

I should write a test that iterates through every possible u8 value and tries to convert it into a Dscp. If any of these conversions cause a panic, the test will fail, indicating that the issue isn't resolved. But after applying the patch, all conversions should succeed, so the test will pass.

I'll name the test test_dscp_from_all_values. It will loop from 0 to 255, and for each value, it will call Dscp::from(value). Since the from() function returns a Dscp, we don't need to check the value, just that it doesn't panic. So the test will simply loop and convert each value, expecting no errors.

I also need to make sure to import the necessary functions. Since Dscp is in the parent module, I'll use super::Dscp. So the import block will have use super::Dscp;.

Putting it all together, the test will look like this: a loop that iterates over all u8 values and attempts to convert each into Dscp. If all conversions succeed, the test passes.
</think>

The test will verify that all 256 possible u8 values can be converted to a Dscp without causing an error. Before the patch, this test would fail because some values were unhandled, but after the patch, all values are covered.
