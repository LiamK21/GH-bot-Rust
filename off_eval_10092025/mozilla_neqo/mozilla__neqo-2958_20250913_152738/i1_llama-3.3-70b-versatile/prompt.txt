Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

`disable-random` not fully working
The `disable-random` feature was added to allow repeatable fuzzing runs. It doesn't seem to fully take effect however. This becomes pretty easy to spot if one runs
```
cargo nextest run --features build-fuzzing-corpus --no-fail-fast
```
twice in a row. That command, under the `fuzzer/corpus`, builds fuzzing corpora for the various fuzzers, i.e, collects input data for the various fuzzers generated during the run of the test suite. `build-fuzzing-corpus` turns on `disable-random` and `disable-encryption`.

There will be *x* files in the `fuzzer/corpus` directory tree after the first run. After a second run, there will be *y* files, where *x < y*.

The reason for the increase is that the second test run generated data that wasn't generated during the first run, which can really only be due to randomization still being present.

We should fix this, since the fuzzing runs should be repeatable.

One hunch is that either the `disable-random` feature isn't fully transitively applied throughout the various crates on compilation. Another hunch is that there is some inherent remaining randomization in the NSS TLS stack.

Function signatures

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at neqo and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block.
 Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
- name
- parameters
- Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
