Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

consider building and pushing Interop Runner Docker image in CI
I noticed that the neqo interop runner image is now 3 years (!) old: https://hub.docker.com/r/neqoquic/neqo-qns/tags. I assume that building / pushing was done manually using [this script](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo/blob/main/qns/update.sh) so far.

May I suggest to push a new interop runner on every push to master, or on a daily (?) cron job? GitHub Actions has some predefined workflows that should make building and pushing Docker images pretty straightforward. For inspiration, [here](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-interop-docker.yml) is quic-go's workflow, and Quinn has [one](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn-interop/blob/main/.github/workflows/dockerhub.yml) as well.

Function signatures
<Signatures>
fn main() -> Res<()>

fn main() -> Result<(), io::Error>
</Signatures>

You are a software tester at neqo and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block.
 Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
- name
- parameters
- Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
