Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Don't grease VN with the version from the client Initial
If the client sends 0x?a?a?a?a, we should not include that version in the VN packet.  A client is required to ignore a VN where the server includes the version they attempted, which applies here too.

The easiest way to fix this is to pass the client packet version into PacketBuilder::version_negotiation and ensure that we don't repeat that when greasing (we can just add 0x10 to the version to avoid a collision).  We should include a test for this, which will be probabilistic, but at 2<sup>-16</sup> odds, we will get test failures often enough if we run the test a few hundred times.

The impact of this is minor: the client should ignore the VN packet and continue sending its Initial.  We probably won't make the same mistake multiple times in a row, but it will add unnecessary latency.

Function signatures

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at neqo and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block.
 Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
- name
- parameters
- Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
