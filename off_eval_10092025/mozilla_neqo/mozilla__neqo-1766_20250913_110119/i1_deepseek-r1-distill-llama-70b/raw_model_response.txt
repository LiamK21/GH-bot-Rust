Alright, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch and, if so, write that test. Let's start by understanding the issue and the patch.

The issue is about WebTransport negotiating the Draft Version, specifically referencing the HTTP/3 section of the WebTransport draft. The patch adds a `stats()` method to both `Http09Client` and `Http3Client`, and modifies the `main.rs` to include a `--stats` flag that prints connection statistics after closing. Additionally, it fixes a formatting issue in `stats.rs` by removing a space before the colon in the debug output.

Now, considering whether a test is needed. The changes here are adding new functionality (the stats method and the command-line flag) and fixing a minor formatting issue. Since these are functional changes, a test is necessary to ensure that the stats are correctly reported and that the formatting issue is resolved.

Looking at the patch, the `stats()` method is implemented for both clients, so the test should verify that calling `stats()` returns the expected data. Also, the `--stats` flag should trigger the printing of these stats.

I should write a test that checks if the stats are correctly captured and printed. The test will likely create a client, perform some actions, close the connection, and then check if the stats are non-default, indicating that data was sent and received.

I'll structure the test by initializing a client, making a request, closing the connection, and then checking the stats. Since the `stats` flag is added, the test can run the client with this flag and verify that the output includes the stats.

I'll need to import the necessary modules, set up the client, and then assert that the stats are not zero or some expected value. The exact implementation will depend on how the stats are structured, but the test should ensure that the changes in the patch are effective.

So, the test will fail before the patch because the `stats()` method wasn't implemented, and after the patch, it should pass as the stats are correctly reported. This ensures the regression is fixed.
