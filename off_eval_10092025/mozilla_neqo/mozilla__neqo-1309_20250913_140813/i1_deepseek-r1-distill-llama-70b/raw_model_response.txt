Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The issue is about treating response code 101 as an error and resetting the stream. Let me look at the patch provided.

First, I see that in the connection_client.rs file, a test called response_w_101 was added. This test sends a 101 response and checks if the stream is reset with the correct error. So, the patch already includes a test for this scenario.

Next, I check the headers_checks.rs file. The function is_interim now returns an error if the status code is 101. This change should cause any code that uses this function to treat 101 as an error, leading to a stream reset.

Since the patch includes a new test that specifically tests the 101 response case, I don't need to write an additional test. The existing test should cover the behavior change. Therefore, no new unit test is necessary beyond what's already in the patch.
