Okay, I need to figure out if a unit test is needed for the given patch. The patch addresses several issues with HFrameReader, including handling cases where a sender closes a stream before sending any data. 

Looking at the patch, I see that they've added new tests in the tests module, like test_complete_and_incomplete_frames and test_frame_reading_when_stream_is_closed_before_sending_data. These tests seem to cover various scenarios, including when a stream is closed before sending data, which was one of the issues mentioned.

The test test_frame_reading_when_stream_is_closed_before_sending_data specifically checks if closing a stream before sending data doesn't cause an error. This directly relates to the first issue in the problem description. 

Since the patch already includes this test, I don't think an additional test is necessary. The existing test should cover the scenario where the stream is closed early, ensuring that the HFrameReader behaves correctly without throwing a MalformedFrame error.

Therefore, no new test is needed because the patch already includes the necessary tests to validate the fixes.
