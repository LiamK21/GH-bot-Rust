Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch and issue. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The issue is about replacing tree-sitter submodules with Rust bindings. Specifically, some grammars are being moved from submodules to Cargo.toml dependencies. The patch provided shows changes in two files: enums/src/macros.rs and src/macros.rs. These changes add support for tree_sitter_javascript by including it in the get_language macro.

Now, I need to determine if a test is needed. Since the patch modifies macros that are used to get the language for JavaScript, any code that relies on this macro might be affected. Without a test, we might not catch regressions if something breaks in the future.

Next, I should think about what the test should check. The test should verify that when the language is set to Javascript, the correct tree-sitter binding is used. So, I'll set the language to Javascript and check that the get_language() function returns the expected language from tree_sitter_javascript.

I need to make sure the test fails before the patch and passes after. Before the patch, the macro didn't include Javascript, so calling get_language() for Javascript would probably cause a compile error or a runtime error. After the patch, it should correctly return the language.

I should write a test that sets LANG to Javascript, calls get_language(), and asserts that it's not null or matches the expected type. This way, if the patch is correctly applied, the test will pass.

I also need to include the necessary imports. Since the test is in the same crate, I'll use super::get_language. I'll import Language from tree_sitter::Language.

Putting it all together, the test will look something like initializing the language, calling get_language(), and asserting the result. This should cover the change and ensure the patch works as intended.

#[test]
fn test_javascript_language() {
    let language = LANG::Javascript;
    let actual = get_language(language);
    assert!(actual.is_some());
    let expected = tree_sitter_javascript::language();
    assert_eq!(actual.unwrap(), expected);
