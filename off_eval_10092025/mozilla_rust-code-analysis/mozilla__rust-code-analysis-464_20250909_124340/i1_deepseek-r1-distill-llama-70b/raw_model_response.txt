Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if a unit test is needed for this patch. Let's start by understanding what the patch does. The issue is about replacing tree-sitter submodules with Rust bindings. Specifically, they're removing some submodules and using Cargo.toml dependencies instead. The patch shows that in two files, enums/src/macros.rs and src/macros.rs, they're adding or modifying entries for tree_sitter_python.

Looking at the patch, in enums/src/macros.rs, they added a line for LANG::Python pointing to tree_sitter_python::language(). In src/macros.rs, they added a new case for tree_sitter_python that returns its language function.

Now, the question is whether a unit test is needed. Since the patch modifies macros that are used to get the language instances, any code that relies on these macros might be affected. If before the patch, the Python language wasn't correctly set up, or if the macro didn't include it, a test would fail. After the patch, it should work.

So, a test is needed to ensure that the get_language() function correctly returns the Python language instance after the patch. The test should check if the language for Python is properly set.

The test should be self-contained. I'll need to import the necessary functions. Since the function under test is in the parent module, I'll use super::get_language with the appropriate argument.

The test will call get_language with "tree_sitter_python" and check that it returns a non-null value, indicating that the language was correctly initialized.

I should structure the test to fail before the patch because the macro didn't handle tree_sitter_python, so get_language would return null. After the patch, it should return a valid Language instance.

So, the test will look something like this: use the get_language function, pass "tree_sitter_python", and assert that the result is not null. This ensures that the patch correctly adds support for Python.
