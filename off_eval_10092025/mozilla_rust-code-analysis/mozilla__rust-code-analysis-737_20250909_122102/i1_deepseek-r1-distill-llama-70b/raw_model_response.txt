Alright, I need to determine whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. The issue is about splitting metrics into average and sum for certain LOC metrics. The patch modifies the `loc.rs` file, adding average calculations and updating the serialization to include these new fields.

First, I'll review the changes. The `Stats` struct now includes `space_count` and has methods like `sloc_average`, which divides the sloc by `space_count`. The tests in the patch have been updated to include these averages, but they're part of the existing test cases within `loc.rs`.

Since the patch already includes comprehensive tests for each metric's average, adding another unit test might be redundant. The existing tests cover various scenarios, ensuring that the averages are correctly calculated based on the number of spaces. Therefore, creating a new unit test would not provide additional coverage beyond what's already been implemented.

I should check if there's any edge case or scenario not covered by the current tests. Looking through the tests, they seem to handle different numbers of spaces and calculate the averages accurately. Without any obvious gaps, it seems that the existing tests are sufficient.

Thus, I conclude that no new unit test is needed because the patch already includes thorough testing of the changes.
