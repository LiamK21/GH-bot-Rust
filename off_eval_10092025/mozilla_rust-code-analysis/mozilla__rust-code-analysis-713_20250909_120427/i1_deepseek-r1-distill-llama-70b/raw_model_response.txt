Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is needed for the given patch. The patch is about adding min and max calculations for various metrics, specifically for cognitive complexity. 

Looking at the patch, I see that several changes were made. The Stats struct in cognitive.rs now includes structural_sum, structural_min, and structural_max. The merge function has been updated to handle these new fields, and new methods like cognitive_sum, cognitive_min, and cognitive_max have been added. Also, the compute_minmax function in spaces.rs now includes cognitive metrics.

Since the patch adds new functionality, a test is definitely needed to ensure that these min and max values are being calculated correctly. Without a test, we can't be sure that the changes work as intended.

Now, I need to write a test that fails before the patch and passes after. The test should check if the cognitive metrics include min and max. 

I'll create a test function that initializes a Stats struct, merges another struct into it, and then checks if the min and max values are correct. Before the patch, the cognitive metrics didn't have min and max, so the test should fail. After the patch, it should pass.

I'll make sure the test is self-contained, includes all necessary imports, and clearly tests the new functionality.

<Filename>src/metrics/cognitive.rs</Filename>
<imports>
use super::Stats;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_cognitive_minmax() {
    let mut stats = Stats::default();
    stats.structural = 5;
    stats.compute_minmax();
    
    let mut other = Stats::default();
    other.structural = 3;
    stats.merge(&other);
    stats.compute_minmax();
    
    assert_eq!(stats.cognitive_min(), 0.0);
    assert_eq!(stats.cognitive_max(), 5.0);
}
</Rust>
