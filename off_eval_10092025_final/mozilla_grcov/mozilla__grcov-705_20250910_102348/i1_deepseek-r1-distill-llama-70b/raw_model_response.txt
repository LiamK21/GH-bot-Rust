Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is required for the given patch. The issue is that installing grcov fails because of a yanked tera version. The patch modifies the code to use a different Context type from the tera crate.

First, I'll look at the patch. It changes the import from `tera::{Context, CtxThreadSafe, Tera}` to `tera::{Context, Tera}`. Also, the function `make_context` is modified to return `Context` instead of `Context<CtxThreadSafe>`.

So, the problem was that grcov was depending on a version of tera that's no longer available. The patch updates the code to use a compatible version. Now, I need to determine if a test is needed to verify this fix.

Since the issue is about dependency resolution, a unit test might not directly test that, but we can test if the function behaves correctly after the change. The function `make_context` is crucial here. It creates a context and inserts a bulma version. The patch changes the return type, so we need to ensure that the function still works as expected.

I should write a test that checks if `make_context` returns a valid Context. The test should fail before the patch because the function would return a Context with a different type, and after the patch, it should return the correct type.

So, the test will call `make_context()`, check if the returned context is of the correct type, and ensure that it contains the expected bulma version. This way, the test will pass only after the patch is applied, confirming that the issue is resolved.

I'll structure the test by initializing any necessary variables, creating the context, and then asserting the contents. The test should be self-contained and not rely on external modules beyond what's necessary.

In the end, the test will only contain the necessary imports, the test function, and the assertions. This should cover the changes made in the patch and ensure that the dependency issue is fixed.

The issue was caused by using a yanked version of tera. The patch updates the code to use a compatible version. A test is needed to verify that the `make_context()` function works correctly with the new tera version.

<Filename> src/html.rs </Filename>
<imports> use super::make_context; use tera::Context; </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_make_context_returns_valid_context() {
    let context = make_context();
    let expected_bulma_version = env!("BULMA_VERSION").as_static_str();
    let actual_bulma_version = context.get::<String>("bulma_version").unwrap();
    
    assert_eq!(expected_bulma_version, actual_bulma_version);
}
</Rust>
