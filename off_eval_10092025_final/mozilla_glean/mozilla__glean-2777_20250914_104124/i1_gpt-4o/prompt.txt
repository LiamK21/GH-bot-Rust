Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

stopAndAccumulate/Cancel methods of FOG TimingDistributions coerce null timerids to 0
Based on our discovery in 1882110 we notice unexpected behavior in FOG.

Specifically, `null` appears to coerce to `0` in the TimingDistribution metrics `stopAndAccumulate` and `cancel` methods. This is an issue because `0` is actually not only a valid timer ID, it is the first one assigned.

As a result, sometimes we are calling stop/cancel in abstracted stopwatches, which causes submission of a `null` timerid. If 0 was already stopped, this results in an `invalidState` error being recorded and in fact that is precisely what we observe with the two Fenix metrics `Geckoview.page_reload_time` and `Geckoview.page_load_time`

There are a few related things that likely need to come from this:

1. 1882110 mitigated in the short term by guarding stop/cancel
2. [this bug] See if FOG can be modified so this behavior does not occur 
3. start timerIDs at 1 if not, in the SDK itself.

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block.
 Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
- name
- parameters
- Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Here is an example structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
