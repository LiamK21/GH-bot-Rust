Okay, I need to figure out whether a unit test is necessary for the given patch. Let's start by understanding what the patch does.

The patch is implementing a stable, monotonic clock for events in Rust. It's based on a proposal and uses Uptime.cpp as a reference. The main changes are:

1. Adding a new function `glean_get_timestamp_ms()` in the FFI layer, which calls `glean_core::get_timestamp_ms()`.
2. Implementing `get_timestamp_ms()` in `glean-core/src/lib.rs` using `zeitstempel::now()` divided by `NANOS_PER_MILLI`.
3. Updating `event.rs` to use this new function instead of calculating the time directly with `time::precise_time_ns()`.

The issue mentions that this new clock should be stable and monotonic, which is crucial for events so that timestamps don't go backward and are consistent.

Now, considering whether a test is needed. Since this change affects the timing mechanism, a test would ensure that the new implementation behaves correctly. Without a test, we might not catch regressions if something changes in the future.

The test should verify that `get_timestamp_ms()` returns a timestamp that doesn't go backward. So, the test can call this function twice with some delay and ensure the second timestamp is greater than or equal to the first.

I should write a test that does the following:
1. Imports the necessary functions.
2. Captures the initial timestamp.
3. Introduces a small delay to ensure time progresses.
4. Captures the second timestamp.
5. Asserts that the second timestamp is not less than the first.

This will ensure the function is monotonic. I don't need to test the exact value, just the order.

So, the test will be named `test_get_timestamp_ms_is_monotonic` and will follow the structure outlined in the example.
</think>

The patch introduces a new function `get_timestamp_ms()` to provide a stable, monotonic clock. A test is needed to ensure this function behaves correctly, specifically that it's non-decreasing over time.

<Filename> glean-core/src/lib.rs </Filename>
<imports> 
use super::get_timestamp_ms;
</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_get_timestamp_ms_is_monotonic() {
    let first_timestamp = get_timestamp_ms();
    // Small delay to ensure time progresses
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10));
    let second_timestamp = get_timestamp_ms();
    assert!(
        second_timestamp >= first_timestamp,
        "Timestamps must be non-decreasing"
    );
}</Rust>
