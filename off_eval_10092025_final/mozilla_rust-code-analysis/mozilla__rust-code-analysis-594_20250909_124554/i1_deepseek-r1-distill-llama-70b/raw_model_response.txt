Okay, I need to figure out if a unit test is necessary for the given patch and, if so, write that test. Let me start by understanding the issue and the patch.

The issue is about replacing tree-sitter submodules with Rust bindings. The patch removes some submodules and replaces them with Cargo dependencies. This should make the repository cleaner and avoid issues with submodule updates.

Looking at the patch, I see changes in two files: enums/src/macros.rs and src/macros.rs. In enums/src/macros.rs, the get_language macro is being updated to use the new bindings. Similarly, in src/macros.rs, the get_language macro is simplified, and several cases are replaced with direct calls to the new bindings.

Now, I need to determine if a test is needed. Since the patch changes how languages are fetched, any functionality relying on get_language() might be affected. If a test isn't written, we might miss regressions where certain languages aren't correctly fetched after the change.

So, a test is needed. The test should check if all the languages can be correctly retrieved after the patch. It should fail before the patch because some languages would be using the old submodule approach, and after the patch, they should use the new bindings.

I'll structure the test to iterate over each language, call get_language(), and ensure it doesn't panic or return unexpected values. Each language should return a non-null Language instance.

I'll write a test that covers all the affected languages. I'll use a match statement to handle each case, but since the patch simplifies this, the test can be straightforward.

The test will be named test_language_retrieval and will loop through each LANG variant, asserting that get_language() returns Some(Language). If any language fails, the test will panic with a message indicating which one.

Now, I'll write the test code, ensuring all necessary imports are included. I'll place the test in the appropriate file and structure it as per the instructions.

    for lang in languages {
        let result = get_language(&lang);
        assert!(
            result.is_some(),
            "Failed to retrieve language for {:?}",
            lang
