Okay, I need to figure out how to create a regression test for the given patch. The issue is about dropping some modifications to the C++ grammar that are now part of upstream. The patch modifies the `Cpp` enum and the `From` implementation for `&'static str`.

First, I should understand what the patch does. It looks like several entries in the `Cpp` enum have been replaced. For example, `OperatorName` (157) has been removed, and new entries like `DASHGTSTAR` (157), `LPARENRPAREN` (158), etc., have been added. Then, in the `From` implementation, the new entries are mapped to their string representations, and `OperatorName` is mapped at a different position.

So, the problem before the patch was that the `Cpp` enum had some tokens that are now handled upstream, so they shouldn't be there anymore. The patch removes those and adds new ones.

To test this, I need to write a test that checks the string representations of these tokens. The test should fail before the patch because, for example, `Cpp::OperatorName` would have been at position 157, but after the patch, it's at a higher position, and the new tokens are added.

So, the test should check the string output for the new tokens. For instance, `Cpp::DASHGTSTAR` should now return "->*", and `Cpp::OperatorName` should still return "operator_name" but at a different index.

I'll structure the test by creating a function that checks each relevant token's string representation. I'll compare the expected strings with the actual results. If the patch is correct, the test should pass after applying it.

I'll need to import the `Cpp` enum from the parent module. Then, in the test function, I'll define the expected strings for each token and assert that the `From` trait correctly converts them.

I should make sure that the test is self-contained and doesn't rely on any external state. Each token's expected string is hardcoded, and the test will fail if any of them don't match after the patch.

So, the test will include checks for `DASHGTSTAR`, `LPARENRPAREN`, `LBRACKRBRACK`, `DQUOTEDQUOTE`, and `OperatorName` to ensure they return the correct strings. This way, if the patch correctly updates these mappings, the test will pass, indicating the issue is resolved.
