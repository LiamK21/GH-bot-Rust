Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 82.71% to 83.33%.

```rust


#[test]
fn test_nom_functions_average() {
    let mut s1 = Stats::default();
    s1.functions_sum = 1;
    s1.space_count = 1;

    let mut s2 = Stats::default();
    s2.functions_sum = 0;
    s2.space_count = 1;

    s1.merge(&s2);

    assert_eq!(s1.functions_average(), 0.5);
}
```
