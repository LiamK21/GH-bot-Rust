Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 81.59% to 82.46%.

```rust
use crate::metrics::nom::Stats;

#[test]
fn test_compute_minmax_updates_min_max() {
    let mut stats = Stats::default();
    stats.functions = 2;
    stats.closures = 1;
    stats.compute_minmax();
    assert_eq!(stats.functions_min, 2);
    assert_eq!(stats.functions_max, 2);
    assert_eq!(stats.closures_min, 1);
    assert_eq!(stats.closures_max, 1);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/metrics/nom.rs` file before running it.
