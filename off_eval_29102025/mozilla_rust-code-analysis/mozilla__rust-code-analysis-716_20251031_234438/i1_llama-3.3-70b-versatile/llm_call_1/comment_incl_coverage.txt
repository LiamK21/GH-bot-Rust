Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 81.59% to 82.79%.

```rust
use crate::metrics::nom::Stats;
use std::usize;

#[test]
fn test_compute_minmax() {
  let mut stats = Stats::default();
  stats.functions = 5;
  stats.closures = 3;
  let expected_functions_min = 5;
  let expected_functions_max = 5;
  let expected_closures_min = 3;
  let expected_closures_max = 3;
  stats.compute_minmax();
  assert_eq!(stats.functions_min() as usize, expected_functions_min);
  assert_eq!(stats.functions_max() as usize, expected_functions_max);
  assert_eq!(stats.closures_min() as usize, expected_closures_min);
  assert_eq!(stats.closures_max() as usize, expected_closures_max);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/metrics/nom.rs` file before running it.
