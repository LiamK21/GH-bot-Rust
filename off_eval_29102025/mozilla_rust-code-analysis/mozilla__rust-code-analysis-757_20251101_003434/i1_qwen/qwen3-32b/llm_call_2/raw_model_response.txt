Okay, let me figure out how to fix this test. The user provided a patch and a test that's failing. The error is about the Cpp enum not implementing Display, which is needed for to_string(). 

Looking at the original code in the patch, there's an impl for From<Cpp> for &'static str. But the test is trying to use .to_string() on a Cpp variant, which requires the Display trait. The problem is that the From implementation doesn't automatically provide Display.

In the original code (before the patch), there was a line like Cpp::OperatorName = 157, which might have had some fields that implemented Display. After the patch, the DASHGTSTAR is added, but since the From trait isn't used for Display, the test is failing.

Wait, the impl From<Cpp> for &'static str defines how to convert Cpp variants to strings. So maybe the correct approach is to implement Display for Cpp using this conversion. The original test was using to_string(), but that's not possible without the Display trait.

So the test should be adjusted to use the conversion from the From trait. For example, converting Cpp::DASHGTSTAR to a &str via the From implementation. That way, the test can check if the string is correct without needing Display.

Therefore, the correct test would cast the Cpp variant to a &str using Into or directly, since the From is implemented. Like: let actual: &str = Cpp::DASHGTSTAR.into(); assert_eq!(actual, "->*"); 

So the imports are okay, and the test case should use the conversion directly instead of to_string(). That way, the test will check if the From implementation works, which was the intended fix. The previous test was incorrect because it relied on Display, which wasn't implemented. The corrected test should pass after the patch and fail before because the DASHGTSTAR wasn't present in the old code.

In the original code (before the patch), the OperatorName was part of the enum, but the new code added DASHGTSTAR. The test is verifying that the new variant is correctly mapped. Therefore, the test should check if Cpp::DASHGTSTAR converts to the correct string using the From trait, which the patch should have fixed.
