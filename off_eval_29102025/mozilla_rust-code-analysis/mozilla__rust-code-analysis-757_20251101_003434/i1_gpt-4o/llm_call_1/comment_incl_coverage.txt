Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 2.92%.

```rust
use super::Cpp;
use std::convert::From;

#[test]
fn test_operator_name_removal() {
    let operator_name_before_patch = Cpp::OperatorName;
    let operator_name_after_patch = Cpp::DASHGTSTAR;

    let expected_before_patch = "operator_name";
    let expected_after_patch = "->*";

    let actual_before_patch = <&str>::from(operator_name_before_patch);
    let actual_after_patch = <&str>::from(operator_name_after_patch);

    assert_eq!(expected_before_patch, actual_before_patch);
    assert_eq!(expected_after_patch, actual_after_patch);
}
```
