Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 77.41% to 78.40%.

```rust


#[test]
fn test_cyclomatic_min_max() {
    let mut stats = Stats::default();
    stats.cyclomatic = 3.0;
    stats.compute_minmax();

    let expected_min = 3.0;
    let expected_max = 3.0;

    let actual_min = stats.cyclomatic_min();
    let actual_max = stats.cyclomatic_max();

    assert_eq!(actual_min, expected_min);
    assert_eq!(actual_max, expected_max);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/metrics/cyclomatic.rs` file before running it.
