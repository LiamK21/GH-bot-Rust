Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 96.61% to 96.66%.

```rust
use std::f64;

#[test]
fn test_cognitive_min_max() {
  let mut stats = Stats::default();
  stats.structural = 5;
  stats.compute_minmax();
  let expected_min: f64 = 5.0;
  let expected_max: f64 = 5.0;
  assert_eq!(stats.cognitive_min(), expected_min);
  assert_eq!(stats.cognitive_max(), expected_max);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/metrics/cognitive.rs` file before running it.
