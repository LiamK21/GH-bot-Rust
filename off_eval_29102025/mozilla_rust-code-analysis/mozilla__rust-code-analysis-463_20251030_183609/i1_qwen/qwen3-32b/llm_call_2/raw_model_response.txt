Okay, I need to fix this test so that it fails before the patch and passes after. Let's see the issue here. The user provided an output error that says the function `get_language` isn't found in the scope. The test is trying to call `get_language()` without specifying the module it's in.

Looking at the patch, the new macro for `tree_sitter_javascript` adds a `get_language` function. But in the current test, it's just calling `get_language()` directly. Before the patch, that function doesn't exist, so the test would fail. But after applying the patch, the function exists in the `tree_sitter_javascript` module.

So the problem is that the test isn't using the correct module path. Instead of calling `get_language()` directly, it should be calling `tree_sitter_javascript::get_language()`. That way, when the patch is applied, the macro defines the function in the correct module, and the test can find it. Before the patch, there's no such function, so the test fails.

Therefore, updating the test to use the fully qualified name should fix this. The imports should also include the necessary modules. Let me check the imports in the TEST block. It has `use tree_sitter_javascript;`, which is correct. But the function is called without the module path. So changing the call to `tree_sitter_javascript::get_language()` would make the test fail before the patch (since the function doesn't exist) and pass after (since the macro adds it).

So the revised test should look like:

let language = tree_sitter_javascript::get_language();

That should resolve the issue. Also, ensuring that the imports are correct. The `get_language` is generated in the macro, so the test needs to reference it properly.

No other imports needed. The test is in `src/macros.rs`, so the module path is correct. Let's write the test accordingly.

<Filename>src/macros.rs</Filename>
<imports>use tree_sitter::Language;
use tree_sitter_javascript;</imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_javascript_language() {
    let language = tree_sitter_javascript::get_language();
    assert!(!language.is_null());
}
</Rust>
