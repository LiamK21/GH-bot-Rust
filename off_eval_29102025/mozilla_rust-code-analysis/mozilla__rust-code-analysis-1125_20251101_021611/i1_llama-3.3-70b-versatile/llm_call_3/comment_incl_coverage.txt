Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 11.90%.

```rust
use super::Mozjs;
use super::Alterator;
use std::vec::Vec;

#[test]
fn test_alterate_function_expression() {
  let node: Mozjs = Mozjs::FunctionExpression;
  let code = b"function foo() {}";
  let span = true;
  let children: Vec<&'static str> = vec![];
  let expected = false;
  let actual = match node {
    Mozjs::String | Mozjs::String2 => true,
    _ => false,
  };
  assert_eq!(actual, expected);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/alterator.rs` file before running it.
