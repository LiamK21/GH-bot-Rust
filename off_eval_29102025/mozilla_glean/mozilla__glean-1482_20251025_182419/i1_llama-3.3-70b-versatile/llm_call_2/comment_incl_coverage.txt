Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 85.71%.

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Read;
use std::path::Path;
use super::record_coverage;

#[test]
fn test_record_coverage() {
  let metric_id = "test_metric";
  let filename = "test_coverage.txt";
  env::set_var("GLEAN_TEST_COVERAGE", filename);
  record_coverage(metric_id);
  let mut file = File::open(filename).unwrap();
  let mut contents = String::new();
  file.read_to_string(&mut contents).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(contents, metric_id.to_string() + "\n");
  std::fs::remove_file(filename).unwrap();
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/coverage.rs` file before running it.
