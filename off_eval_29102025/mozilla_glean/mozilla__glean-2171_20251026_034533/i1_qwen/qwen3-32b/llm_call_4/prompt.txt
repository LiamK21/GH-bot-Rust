Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Rust Beta tests on TC fail for Glean with a timeout
Failing task: https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/SINAc7DMT6msCR0mWDhIuA
Log: https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/SINAc7DMT6msCR0mWDhIuA/runs/0/logs/public/logs/live.log

Always the same 2 tests hanging:

```
[task 2022-07-20T13:35:57.055Z] test test::registering_pings_before_init_must_work has been running for over 60 seconds
[task 2022-07-20T13:35:57.061Z] test test::send_a_ping has been running for over 60 seconds
[taskcluster:error] Task timeout after 1800 seconds. Force killing container.
```

I don't know when that started, maybe with the latest beta?
It occasionally is fine, stable is fine all the time.

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.The test should fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test verifies that the patch resolves the issue.
However, the test currently fails after the patch.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand why the unit test failed.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
