Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Remove infill 0 buckets from custom_distributions as well
In Firefox Desktop a team is about to add a 2^32-bucket `custom_distribution` (for counts of connections per port, if you're curious). `custom_distribution` metrics are currently [padded with 0-count buckets](https://searchfox.org/glean/source/glean-core/src/histogram/mod.rs#126), and so we might find ourselves with a very expensive piece of data collection all of a sudden.

Maybe we should drop the 0-count buckets, like we did for `timing_distribution` and `memory_distribution` in bug 1898336? Or maybe we should make it optional somehow?

As far as I can remember, these buckets were included so that bucket dimensions could always be determined by information contained solely within the payload. If we want to continue with that promise, maybe we could do that with just adjacent 0-count buckets?

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).
