Okay, let's see. The user wants me to create a regression test for the patch that upgrades the glean-parser to version 8.1.0. The patch changes the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION from "8.0.0" to "8.1.0" in the lib.rs file of the build directory.

First, I need to determine if a unit test is needed. The patch is updating a constant string value. It doesn't involve complex logic or functions that require runtime testing. The Builder struct is mentioned, but the code provided doesn't show any method implementations or functions that depend on this constant. 

Since this is a version string change, and there's no test that checks the version at runtime in the provided code, a unit test might not be necessary unless there's a downstream check that relies on the version. However, given the information, the user is asking if a test is needed. If there's no existing test that uses this constant to verify the version, then changing it wouldn't affect any tests unless such a test exists.

The user might expect that this version is used somewhere else, like when generating code or validating the parser. But without any modified function signatures and the lack of functions that actually use the version at runtime, creating a test from scratch would be challenging. 

The task is to check if existing test(s) would fail without the patch. But since there's no test that checks the version, the change would not impact existing tests. Therefore, a new test is not needed unless the function under test uses the version. But since the code sample only shows a constant change and no function that uses it, the answer is that no test is needed here. Also, creating a test would require knowing how the version is utilized, which isn't evident from the patch provided.
