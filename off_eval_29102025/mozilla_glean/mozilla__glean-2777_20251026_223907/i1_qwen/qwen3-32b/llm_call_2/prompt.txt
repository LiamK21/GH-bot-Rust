Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Issue:
<issue>
stopAndAccumulate/Cancel methods of FOG TimingDistributions coerce null timerids to 0
Based on our discovery in 1882110 we notice unexpected behavior in FOG.

Specifically, `null` appears to coerce to `0` in the TimingDistribution metrics `stopAndAccumulate` and `cancel` methods. This is an issue because `0` is actually not only a valid timer ID, it is the first one assigned.

As a result, sometimes we are calling stop/cancel in abstracted stopwatches, which causes submission of a `null` timerid. If 0 was already stopped, this results in an `invalidState` error being recorded and in fact that is precisely what we observe with the two Fenix metrics `Geckoview.page_reload_time` and `Geckoview.page_load_time`

There are a few related things that likely need to come from this:

1. 1882110 mitigated in the short term by guarding stop/cancel
2. [this bug] See if FOG can be modified so this behavior does not occur 
3. start timerIDs at 1 if not, in the SDK itself.

Function signatures

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
