Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 92.86%.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::io;
use super::spawn;
use std::result::Result;

#[test]
fn test_thread_spawn() {
  let handle: Result<std::thread::JoinHandle<()>, std::io::Error> = spawn("test_thread", || {
    assert_eq!("test_thread", std::thread::current().name().unwrap());
  });
  match handle {
    Ok(handle) => {
      let result = handle.join();
      assert!(result.is_ok());
    },
    Err(e) => {
      assert!(false, "Error spawning thread: {}", e);
    }
  }
}
```
