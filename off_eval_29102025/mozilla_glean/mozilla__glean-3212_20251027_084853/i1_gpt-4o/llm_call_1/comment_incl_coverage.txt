Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 100.00%.

```rust
use super::spawn;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

#[test]
fn test_thread_registration_with_gecko_profiler() {
    let handle = spawn("test_thread", || {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    }).expect("Failed to spawn thread");

    handle.join().expect("Thread panicked");
}
```
