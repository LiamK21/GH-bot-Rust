Okay, let's see. The user asked if there's a shutdown API for Glean in Swift, and the patch adds a `glean_shutdown` function in Rust. The task is to write a regression test for this change.

First, I need to check if a test is needed. The patch introduces a new public function, `glean_shutdown`, which calls `shutdown()`. Since this is a new function, a unit test should verify that it exists and behaves correctly. But how to test it? `shutdown()` might not have side effects that are easy to test without mocking. However, maybe the `shutdown` function in the code does something that can be observed.

Wait, the function `glean_shutdown` is supposed to shut down Glean properly. Without knowing the implementation details of `shutdown()`, it's hard to test its behavior. But maybe the test can just ensure that calling `glean_shutdown` doesn't panic. Or perhaps check that after shutdown, certain functions can't be used anymore. But without more context, the simplest test is to check that the function exists and can be called without causing an error.

So a unit test could be a test that calls `glean_shutdown` and expects it to not panic. Before the patch, this function doesn't exist, so the test would fail. After the patch, it exists, so the test passes.

Now, how to structure the test. Since the function is in the same module, the test in `glean-core/src/lib.rs` should be under the existing test module. But according to the user's instructions, the test should be a `#[test]` function outside of any `mod tests` if the existing code doesn't have one. Wait, the example shows that if the file already has a test in the patch, the new test should be added with a unique name. However, the current patch doesn't show any existing tests. So the test can be written in the same module.

The function is public, so the test can call `glean_shutdown()`. The test needs to verify that it's present and callable. Since the function returns nothing, the test can just call it and assert that it doesn't panic.

So the test would be:

#[test]
fn test_glean_shutdown_exists_and_does_not_panic() {
    glean_shutdown();
}

But before the patch, this function doesn't exist, so the test would not compile, hence the regression test would fail. After applying the patch, it exists, so the test passes.

Now, the use statements. The test is in the same module as the function, so no imports are needed. Unless `glean_shutdown` is in a different module. Wait, since the function is added in the same file, and the test is in the same file, no `use` statements are required. Therefore, the <imports> can be empty.

The filename is `glean-core/src/lib.rs` as given in the patch.

So the final answer is the filename, no imports, and the test that calls `glean_shutdown`.

<Filename> glean-core/src/lib.rs </Filename>
<imports> </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_glean_shutdown_can_be_called() {
    glean_shutdown();
}
</Rust>
