Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they need to allow user-agent customization. The patch removes a comment in the PingRequest::new function that mentioned clients could add more headers like userAgent. So the question is, was there a test that checked if custom headers like user agent could be added, and now that the comment is removed, does that affect the functionality?

Wait, the patch only changes a comment. The actual code isn't modified. So the function still creates a PingRequest, but the comment says that clients may add more headers. But maybe after removing the comment, the functionality is the same. But the issue says that customizing the user agent is not used. Maybe the code used to allow adding headers but that feature is no longer supported. However, the code hasn't changed. So how can there be a regression test here?

Ah, maybe the test is needed to ensure that the code doesn't allow adding custom headers anymore. Wait, but the code still allows it. The change was just removing a comment. So perhaps the test that was checking for the presence of the comment in documentation should be removed. Or maybe the test isn't needed because the functionality hasn't changed. The patch is a documentation change, so maybe there's no test needed. The problem is that the issue says they don't need to allow user-agent customization. But the code is not changing the functionality, just the comment.

Wait, perhaps the code actually used to allow adding headers, but now they're removing the comment to indicate that adding custom headers is not allowed. But if the code still allows it, how does the patch fix the issue? The user says that the user agent can be customized from the configuration but it's never used. So maybe the intention is to remove the ability to customize the user agent. But the patch doesn't change any function that allows setting headers. So perhaps the test is checking that headers can't be added after the patch. But without modifying the function to prevent adding headers, the test would fail. But the patch only removes the comment. So maybe the test is supposed to ensure that the function no longer allows adding headers, but the code hasn't changed, so that test would fail even after the patch. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the test was previously in place to check adding headers, but since that's not needed anymore, the test should be removed. But the user is asking if a unit test is needed for the patch. Since the patch only removes a comment, the functionality remains the same, and the test isn't changed. Therefore, maybe no new test is needed here. Because the comment's removal doesn't affect the code's behavior. So the correct answer is <NO>.
