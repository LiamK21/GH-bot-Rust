Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

<issue>
glean-core's "metrics" ping scheduler never sends pings with reason "upgrade"
The core MPS very cleverly checks the stored value of the app build id that last sent a "metrics" ping of reason "upgrade" and, if it's different from the current app build id, sends a new ping and sets the value.

...only problem is the first case: the core MPS doesn't set a value to that internal storage if there isn't already one in there.

This bug's about making the core MPS properly send "metrics" pings with reason "upgrade". And also ensuring we (per [docs](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html)) send a ping with reason "overdue" if in fact this is the first time we've ever started since being installed.

Might be worth filing a follow-up to update [notable historic events](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/analysis_gotchas.html#notable-historic-events) with this after it gets in a release and is vendored.

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently contains linting issues, which are inside the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the linting issue introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block to resolve these issues.
3. The test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:

  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
