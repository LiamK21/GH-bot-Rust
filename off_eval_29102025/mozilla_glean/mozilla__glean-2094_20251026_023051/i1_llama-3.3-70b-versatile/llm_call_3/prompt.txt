Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Make all exported metrics definition types more convenient for use with serde
It would be convenient for FOG if the Glean SDK would make all of `CommonMetricData` `Deserialize` so metric definition information could be parsed from a string (for the purposes of dynamic registration of metrics (JOG)).

With the power of [serde remote derivation](https://serde.rs/remote-derive.html) JOG may be able to get `CommonMetricData` to work if only Lifetime is `Deserialize`, but that would be less convenient.

JOG doesn't need `Serialize` since the serialization for artefact builds will happen at build time in a Python environment, not a Rust one. However, if we're looking ahead to Dynamic Telemetry (where definition information comes over the wire) then it might be beneficial to have `Serialize` as well.

What might be noteworthy is that, already, quite a few other exported metric definition types (`TimeUnit`, `MemoryUnit`, `HistogramType`) are convenient for use with serde, so really we're just bringing the rest of these types up to standard : )

Function signatures
<Signatures>

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
