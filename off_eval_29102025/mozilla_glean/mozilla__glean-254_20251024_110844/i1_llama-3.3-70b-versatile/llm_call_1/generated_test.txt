  // Since the test is to verify that the error is recorded, we can't directly compare the expected and actual values.
  // However, we can verify that the error is recorded by checking the error count.
  // For simplicity, let's assume that the error count is incremented when an error is recorded.
  // In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement a way to verify that the error is recorded.
