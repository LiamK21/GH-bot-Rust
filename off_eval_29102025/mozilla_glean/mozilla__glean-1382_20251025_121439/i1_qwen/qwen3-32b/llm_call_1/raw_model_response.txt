Okay, I need to create a regression test for the patch that removes docstrings from RLB trait implementations. The issue says that rustdoc uses the trait's docstring if the implementation doesn't have one, so removing duplicates. The patch removes doc comments from various trait implementations.

First, I should check if there's a test needed here. Since the patch is about documentation and not functionality, maybe a test isn't necessary. But perhaps the test is to ensure that the doc comments are actually missing from the implemented traits, ensuring that after the patch, they don't exist anymore. However, how do I test for the presence or absence of doc comments in Rust code?

Wait, the problem isn't about the presence of comments in the code but in the generated documentation. So maybe a unit test isn't the right approach here. However, the user wants a regression test that would verify that the patch was applied correctly. If the patch were reverted, the test should fail again.

But testing documentation isn't straightforward in Rust. Unit tests don't check documentation comments. Hmm. Maybe the test isn't supposed to verify the documentation, but rather the behavior of the code remains correct after removing the comments.

Wait, the functionality of the code isn't changing. The patch is removing documentation comments, but the code's behavior remains the same. So the test should verify that the code still works as before. But what's the actual change? The absence of doc comments might affect what's shown in rustdoc, but that's not something a unit test can check.

But maybe the user expects a test that the functions behave as expected. However, the patch doesn't change function behavior. So the test can't be about the runtime behavior. Therefore, perhaps this isn't something that can be tested with a unit test. The user might have to rely on documentation checks.

But the user is asking for a regression test. Maybe the test is to check that the code compiles after the changes. However, the code should compile without the doc comments. Alternatively, maybe the test is to ensure that certain methods don't have doc comments, which would require some kind of tooling not part of the standard library.

Alternatively, perhaps the test is to check that the methods' documentation is inherited correctly from the trait. But again, that's part of the documentation generation process, not the runtime testable behavior.

In this case, perhaps there's no test needed. The correct approach is to run rustdoc and verify that the generated docs include the correct comments from the trait. But since that requires a different tooling setup and the user wants a unit test in the code, there's no way to write a Rust test that verifies the presence or absence of doc comments.

But the user's instruction says if a test is needed, write it, else return <NO>. Given that the patch only removes comments and doesn't change any code behavior, the test is not necessary. Therefore, the correct response is <NO>.
