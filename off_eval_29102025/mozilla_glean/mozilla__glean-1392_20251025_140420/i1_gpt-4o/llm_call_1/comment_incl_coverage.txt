Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 4.50%.

```rust
use super::set_experiment_inactive;
use super::block_on_dispatcher;
use super::was_initialize_called;
use super::destroy_glean;
use super::lock_test;

#[test]
fn test_block_on_dispatcher_panics_before_initialize() {
    let _lock = lock_test();

    destroy_glean(true);
    assert!(!was_initialize_called());

    let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
        block_on_dispatcher();
    });
    let err = result.unwrap_err();

    assert!(err.is::<&str>());
    let err = err.downcast_ref::<&str>().unwrap();
    assert!(
        err.contains("initialize was never called"),
        "Got the wrong panic message"
    );
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/rlb/src/test.rs` file before running it.
