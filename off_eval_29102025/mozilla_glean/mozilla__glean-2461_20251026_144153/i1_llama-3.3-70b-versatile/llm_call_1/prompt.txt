Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Crash in [@ shutdownhang | RtlpWaitOnAddressWithTimeout | RtlpWaitOnAddress | RtlWaitOnAddress | WaitOnAddress] in Glean
Shutdown hang reported for Windows 10 and 11 which got more frequent with Firefox 111.0.x (6000 crash reports vs. 450 for 110.0.x).

Crash report: https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/47e42dbc-f99c-474f-8154-bbf470230413

MOZ_CRASH Reason: ```Shutdown hanging at step XPCOMShutdown. Something is blocking the main-thread.```

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed or you believe you need additional testing resources beyond the Rust standard library (e.g., mocking libraries) to write a useful unit test, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
If the file you are adding the test already contains a test in the <patch>, ensure that the test name is unique.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
