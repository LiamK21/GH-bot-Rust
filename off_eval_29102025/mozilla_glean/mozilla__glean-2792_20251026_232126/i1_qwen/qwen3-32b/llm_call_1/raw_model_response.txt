Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to determine if a unit test is needed for the provided patch. The issue is about allowing Server Knobs to enable and disable pings. The patch changes the GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION from 13.0.0 to 14.0.1 in the build library.

First, I need to check if the patch actually addresses the issue. The issue is about enabling/disabling pings via server knobs. But the patch only updates a version constant. That's confusing. The version bump might be related to a dependency that introduces the server knobs functionality. However, the code in the patch doesn't touch any logic related to server knobs or pings. The Builder struct is present, but the patch doesn't show any changes to its methods or new functions.

Since there's no actual code modification to the functionality mentioned in the issue (only a version change), there's no new or modified code to test. The test would need to verify that the server knobs can control pings, but the patch doesn't implement that. The version update is just a dependency change, not the implementation of the feature. Therefore, no unit test is needed here. The correct response is to return <NO> because the patch doesn't add any testable logic related to the issue.
