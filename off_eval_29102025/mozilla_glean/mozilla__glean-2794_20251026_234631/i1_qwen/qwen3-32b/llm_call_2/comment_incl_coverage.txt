Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 0.00%.

```rust
use malloc_size_of::MallocSizeOf;
use malloc_size_of::MallocSizeOfOps;

// Dummy functions required for the MallocSizeOfOps.
unsafe extern "C" fn size_of(_: *const std::os::raw::c_void) -> usize { 0 }
unsafe extern "C" fn enclosing_size(_: *const std::os::raw::c_void) -> usize { 0 }

#[test]
fn test_ping_payloads_by_directory_size_of() {
    let instance = PingPayloadsByDirectory {
        pending_pings: Vec::new(),
        deletion_request_pings: Vec::new(),
    };
    let mut ops = MallocSizeOfOps::new(size_of, Some(enclosing_size));
    let size = instance.size_of(&mut ops);
    assert!(size >= 0);
}
```
