Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 0.00%.

```rust
use malloc_size_of::MallocSizeOf;
use malloc_size_of::MallocSizeOfOps;

#[test]
fn test_exponential_range_memory_usage() {
    let min = 1;
    let max = 100;
    let bucket_count = 10;
    let expected = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 16, 29, 54, 100];
    let actual = exponential_range(min, max, bucket_count);
    assert_eq!(expected, actual);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/histogram/exponential.rs` file before running it.
