Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Consider adding uploader_capabilities string list instrumentation to pings
Right now it's tough to validate that any given received ping was uploaded with any given combination of `uploader_capabilities`. On the client we have assurances (we know what was compiled in from `pings.yaml` and we know what was stored to disk), but once the ping leaves the client there's nothing about it that says one way or another.

It seems as though we should instrument the `uploader_capabilities` so that pings uploaded with them are annotated with them.

The fun piece might be figuring out where to put this instrumentation:
* `ping_info` feels like the right place, but some `uploader_capabilities` (notably ones that contain `'ohttp'`) require `include_info_sections: false`
* putting it in the payload: we'd have to be careful about timing it for when the ping is submitted in case the `uploader_capabilities` under which the ping was created do not match those when it gets handed to the uploader. This might make testing difficult when using `test_before_next_submit`.
* putting it in a header could be tricky to 1) make certain it's available in the data afterwards (I _think_ `metadata.headers` would be straightforward to augment, but I've not done it before), and 2) make certain it's in the correct headers that'll make it through all the encode and decode steps that might be required for combinations of `uploader_capabilities`

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).
