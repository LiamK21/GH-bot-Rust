Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Consider adding uploader_capabilities string list instrumentation to pings
Right now it's tough to validate that any given received ping was uploaded with any given combination of `uploader_capabilities`. On the client we have assurances (we know what was compiled in from `pings.yaml` and we know what was stored to disk), but once the ping leaves the client there's nothing about it that says one way or another.

It seems as though we should instrument the `uploader_capabilities` so that pings uploaded with them are annotated with them.

The fun piece might be figuring out where to put this instrumentation:
* `ping_info` feels like the right place, but some `uploader_capabilities` (notably ones that contain `'ohttp'`) require `include_info_sections: false`
* putting it in the payload: we'd have to be careful about timing it for when the ping is submitted in case the `uploader_capabilities` under which the ping was created do not match those when it gets handed to the uploader. This might make testing difficult when using `test_before_next_submit`.
* putting it in a header could be tricky to 1) make certain it's available in the data afterwards (I _think_ `metadata.headers` would be straightforward to augment, but I've not done it before), and 2) make certain it's in the correct headers that'll make it through all the encode and decode steps that might be required for combinations of `uploader_capabilities`

Function signatures
<Signatures>

</Signatures>

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
Identify whether a unit test is needed.
If there is no test needed or you believe you need additional testing resources beyond the Rust standard library (e.g., mocking libraries) to write a useful unit test, return <NO>.
If a test is needed, your task is:
1. Write exactly one rust test `#[test]fn test_...(){...}` block. Do NOT wrap the test inside a 'mod tests' block.
If the file you are adding the test already contains a test in the <patch>, ensure that the test name is unique.
2. Your test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
3. The test must be self-contained and to-the-point.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
