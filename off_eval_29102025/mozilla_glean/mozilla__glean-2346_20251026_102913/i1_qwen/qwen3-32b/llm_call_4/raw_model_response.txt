Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to update the test so that it fails before the patch and passes after. The current test checks if GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION is not equal to "6.4.0". But before the patch, the old version was "6.4.0", so the test would pass because assert_ne! would be true. Wait, no—if the original code had GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION as "6.4.0", then the test asserting it's not equal to "6.4.0" would fail. But the user says the test currently passes before the patch. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe the patch changes the version from "6.4.0" to "7.0.0". So before the patch, the version is "6.4.0". The test as written is checking that the version is not "6.4.0", which would fail because it is. But the user says the test passes before the patch. That can't be right. Wait, no—if the test is written as assert_ne!(GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, "6.4.0"), then when the version is "6.4.0", the test would fail. But the user claims the test currently passes before the patch. That must be a mistake. So perhaps the initial test was written incorrectly. The user wants the test to fail before the patch and pass after. So the correct approach is to have the test check that the version is "7.0.0" after the patch. Therefore, before the patch (when it's 6.4.0), the test would fail. After the patch (7.0.0), it would pass. But the current test is checking that the version is not 6.4.0. So before the patch, it's 6.4.0, so assert_ne! would make the test fail. But the user says the test passes before the patch. That's contradictory. Wait, maybe the initial test was written correctly but the user's understanding is off. Hmm.

Wait, let's think again. The patch changes the version from 6.4.0 to 7.0.0. The existing test is asserting that GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION is not 6.4.0. So before the patch, the version is 6.4.0. The test would check if it's not equal. So the condition would be false, leading to a test failure. But the user says the test currently passes before the patch. That's a contradiction. So there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the test is written to assert_eq! instead of assert_ne! But in the given test, it's using assert_ne!. So why is the test passing before the patch?

Wait, perhaps the patch was already applied in the test environment? No, the user is saying that the test is part of the PR. So the original code had 6.4.0, and the patch changes it to 7.0.0. The existing test checks that the version is not 6.4.0. So before the patch, the test would fail because the version is 6.4.0. But the user is saying the test currently passes before the patch. That can't be. So the user might have a mistake in their test. But the user's task is to fix it.

The correct approach is to write a test that checks for the new version. So after the patch, the version is 7.0.0. The test should check that it is 7.0.0. So the test should be:

assert_eq!(GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, "7.0.0");

Therefore, before the patch, the test would fail (since it's 6.4.0), and after the patch, it would pass. The existing test is incorrect because it's using assert_ne! against the old version. So the correct test is to use assert_eq! against the new version. That way, before the patch, it fails (since the version is old), and after the patch, it passes (version is new). Therefore, the user's test was using assert_ne! against the old version, which would pass after the patch but fail before. Wait, no. If the test is assert_ne! against the old version, after the patch the version is new (7.0.0), so the test passes (because 7.0.0 != 6.4.0). But before the patch, the version is 6.4.0, so the test would fail. So the existing test is correct. But the user says the test currently passes before the patch, which would mean that in the original code, the version was not 6.4.0. That's impossible. There's a disconnect here. Wait, perhaps the initial code was already using a different version? Or maybe the patch is a cherry-pick or something. Wait, no, the patch shows the change from 6.4.0 to 7.0.0. So the existing code before the patch is 6.4.0. The test is asserting that it's not 6.4.0. So before the patch, the test would fail. But the user says the test passes before the patch. Therefore, there's an error in the user's test. Therefore, the user needs to correct the test.

The user's goal is to have the test fail before the patch and pass after. To do that, the test should check that the version is 7.0.0. So the correct test is:

assert_eq!(GLEAN_PARSER_VERSION, "7.0.0");

That way, before the patch, the version is 6.4.0, so it fails. After the patch, it's 7.0.0, so it passes. Therefore, the existing test is using assert_ne! against the old version, which would pass after the patch but fail before. But the user is saying the test is passing before the patch. Which doesn't align. Therefore, the existing test is incorrect. The correct approach is to change the test to check for equality to the new version, not inequality to the old. Thus, the correction is to use assert_eq!.
