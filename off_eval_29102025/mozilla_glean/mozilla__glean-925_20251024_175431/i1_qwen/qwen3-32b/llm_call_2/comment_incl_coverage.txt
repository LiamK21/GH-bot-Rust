Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 6.25%.

```rust
use std::mem;
use crate::Lifetime;

#[test]
fn test_lifetime_size() {
    assert_eq!(mem::size_of::<Lifetime>(), 4);
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/src/common_metric_data.rs` file before running it.
