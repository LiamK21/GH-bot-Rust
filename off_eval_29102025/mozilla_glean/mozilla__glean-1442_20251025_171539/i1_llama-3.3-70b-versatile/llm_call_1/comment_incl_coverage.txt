Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 0.00%.

```rust
use super::glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher;
use log::info;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use std::sync::Arc;

#[test]
fn test_glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher() {
  let initialized = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
  let initialized_clone = Arc::clone(&initialized);
  std::thread::spawn(move || {
    glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher();
    initialized_clone.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
  });
  while !initialized.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {}
  info!("Test glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher passed");
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `glean-core/ffi/src/lib.rs` file before running it.
