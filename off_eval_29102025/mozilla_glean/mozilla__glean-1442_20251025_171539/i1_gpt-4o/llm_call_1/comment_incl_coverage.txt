Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 0.00%.

```rust
use super::glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use std::sync::Once;

#[test]
fn test_glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher() {
    static INIT: Once = Once::new();
    static WAS_CALLED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

    // Mock the rlb_flush_dispatcher function
    #[no_mangle]
    extern "C" fn rlb_flush_dispatcher() {
        WAS_CALLED.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
    }

    // Ensure the mock is only set up once
    INIT.call_once(|| {
        unsafe {
            rlb_flush_dispatcher();
        }
    });

    // Call the function under test
    glean_flush_rlb_dispatcher();

    // Check if the mock function was called
    assert!(WAS_CALLED.load(Ordering::SeqCst));
}
```
