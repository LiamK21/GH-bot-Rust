Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

<issue>
Use a unbounded queue for preinit, but have it act like a bounded queue
We would like to evaluate making the pre-init queue considerably larger (for example, to ameliorate https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1780035), but bounded queues are fully preallocated.

Unbounded queues are linked lists that add 32 nodes at a time. In fact, for most glean initializations, this will create smaller queues, which is great, and also in the case of large pre-init queues, it can grow rather than be pre-allocated.

The only drawback is that if Glean never finishes initializing, it could grow indefinitely. 

We will move the size checking to Glean to allow for the potential increase of the preinit maximum queue size.

You are a software tester at glean and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).
