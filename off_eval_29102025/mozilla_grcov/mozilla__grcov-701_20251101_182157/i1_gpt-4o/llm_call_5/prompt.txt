Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

`cargo install grcov` fails due to modern `tera` versions
The `tera` dependency in `Cargo.toml` isn't properly specified and as a result, all recent `grcov` releases fail to install using something like `cargo install grcov`.

For example, with a Rust 1.52 toolchain (`1.52.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`),  attempting  `cargo install grcov` results in:
```
error[E0107]: missing generics for struct `tera::Context`

   --> /usr/local/cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/tera-1.14.0/src/context.rs:57:12

error: could not compile `grcov` due to previous error
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: failed to compile `grcov v0.8.2`, intermediate artifacts can be found at `/tmp/cargo-installngIiQg`

Caused by:
  build failed

```

Either the `grcov` code should be updated or at least the dependency tightened to use older `tera` versions that do not have this problem.

Using `cargo install --locked` isn't very nice as at least one package is already "yanked".

You are a software tester at grcov and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently contains linting issues, which are inside the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the linting issue introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block to resolve these issues.
3. The test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
