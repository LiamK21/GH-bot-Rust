Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 92.06% to 94.10%.

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use tempfile::tempdir;

#[test]
fn test_llvm_profiles_to_lcov_with_threads() {
    let tmp_dir = tempdir().unwrap();
    let tmp_path = tmp_dir.path();

    let profdata_path = tmp_path.join("grcov.profdata");
    let binary_path = tmp_path.join("binary");
    let profile_path = tmp_path.join("default.profraw");

    let mut binary_file = File::create(&binary_path).unwrap();
    writeln!(binary_file, "binary content").unwrap();

    let mut profile_file = File::create(&profile_path).unwrap();
    writeln!(profile_file, "profile content").unwrap();

    let result = llvm_profiles_to_lcov(
        &[profile_path],
        &binary_path,
        tmp_path,
        4, // Using 4 threads
    );

    assert!(result.is_err(), "Expected error due to invalid profile data");
}
