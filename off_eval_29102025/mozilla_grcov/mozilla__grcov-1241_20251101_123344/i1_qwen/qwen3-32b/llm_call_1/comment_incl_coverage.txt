Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 94.02% to 94.10%.

```rust


#[test]
fn test_lcov_parser_incomplete_DA_record() {
    let buffer = "DA:152,4\nDA:153,4\nDA:154,8\nDA:156,12\nDA\n".as_bytes().to_vec();
    let result = parse_lcov(buffer, true);
    assert!(result.is_err());
    let error = result.unwrap_err();
    assert_eq!(error.to_string(), "Invalid record: 'DA at line 5'");
}
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `src/parser.rs` file before running it.
