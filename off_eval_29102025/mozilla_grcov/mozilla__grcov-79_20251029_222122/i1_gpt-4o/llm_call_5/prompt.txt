Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

<issue>
Support outputting branch coverage information in LCOV format
Currently we support outputting it in the Coveralls format, we should support the LCOV format too.

Function signatures
<Signatures>
pub fn output_lcov(results: CovResultIter) -> ()
</Signatures>

You are a software tester at grcov and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently fails on codebase after the patch, which the errors in the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the errors introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block in order for it to fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence verifying that the patch resolves the issue.
3. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
4. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
5. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
}</Rust>
