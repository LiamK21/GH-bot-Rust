Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 3.27% to 4.31%.

```rust


#[test]
fn test_get_percentage_of_covered_lines_partial_coverage() {
    let result = get_percentage_of_covered_lines(1, 3);
    assert!((result - 33.333333).abs() < 0.0001);
}
```
