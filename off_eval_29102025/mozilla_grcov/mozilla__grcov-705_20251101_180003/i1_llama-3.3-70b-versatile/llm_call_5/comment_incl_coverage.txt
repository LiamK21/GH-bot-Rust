Hi! 🤖 The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes on the PR, 
- fails in the codebase before the PR, and
- increases line coverage from 0.00% to 5.39%.

```rust
use tera::Context;
use std::env;
use super::make_context;

#[test]
fn test_make_context_returns_context_without_ctx_thread_safe() {
  let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
    let _ = make_context();
  });
  assert!(result.is_ok());
}

#[test]
fn test_make_context_fails_when_cast_to_ctx_thread_safe() {
  let result = std::panic::catch_unwind(|| {
    let _ = make_context() as Context;
    panic!("Should not be able to cast to Context with CtxThreadSafe");
  });
  assert!(result.is_err());
}
```
