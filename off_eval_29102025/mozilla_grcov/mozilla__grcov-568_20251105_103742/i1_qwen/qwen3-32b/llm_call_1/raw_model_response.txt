Okay, let me try to figure out what's needed here. The issue is about removing the `check_gcov_version` function because it's no longer used. The patch shows that this function and its associated tests have been removed from the codebase.

First, I need to check if there's a unit test that should be added here. The original code had tests for `check_gcov_version` under both Unix and Windows. But since the function is being removed, those tests are also being deleted. The user is asking if a new test is needed.

The problem is that the function is being removed because it's not used anywhere. So, maybe there's no need to test it anymore. But the user wants to ensure that the patch correctly addresses the issue. However, since the function is removed, the existing tests are removed as well. The user wants a regression test that would fail before the patch and pass after. 

But wait, the patch removes the function. So if we were to create a test that uses `check_gcov_version`, it would fail before the patch (if the test is written to expect its absence), but after the patch, the function is gone. Hmm. That seems conflicting. Wait, the issue says the function is "no longer used anywhere". So the patch is deleting it. The tests that are being removed were testing that function. The user wants to verify that the patch removes the function. But how to test that? Maybe there's no unit test needed because there's nothing to test. The patch is about deleting code, not modifying it. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user might be asking if there's a test needed for the remaining code. But the only modified function in the patch is `check_gcov_version`, which is removed. The remaining code is `parse_version`, but the patch doesn't modify it. The patch only removes code. So perhaps there's no test needed for the patch, since the existing code isn't changed. The existing test for `parse_version` is still present in the patch.

Therefore, since the function is being removed and there's no further code changes, there's no unit test needed. The answer would be <NO>. But wait, the user might be concerned about ensuring that `check_gcov_version` is indeed not used. But in Rust, if the function is deleted, there's no way to test its absence without some kind of metadata test. That's not typical in Rust, and would require checking that references to the function don't exist elsewhere, which is outside normal unit testing. Since the user says to use the Rust standard library and no extra tools, that's probably not feasible.

So the conclusion is that no test is needed for this patch. Hence, the response is <NO>.
