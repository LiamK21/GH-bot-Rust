Before you begin:
- Keep going until the job is completely solved — don’t stop halfway.
- If you’re unsure about the behavior, reread the provided patch carefully; do not hallucinate.
- Plan your approach before writing code by reflecting on whether the test truly fails before and passes after.

Cobertura report doesn't contain proper class line coverage
The cobertura report format introduced with #599 seems to [only report orphan lines on class level](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/blob/master/src/cobertura.rs#L314).

While the cobertura format itself is not properly specified, it seems that pretty much all other test frameworks and reporters always add the full coverage data on class level and not just orphan lines. This can also be seen when looking at example reports created by cobertura itself, e.g. the [cobertura example report for the official Jenkins cobertura plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin/blob/master/src/test/resources/hudson/plugins/cobertura/coverage-with-data.xml). The lack of this data causes incompatibilities with reporting tools like [GitLab's cobertura artefact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/test_coverage_visualization.html): **[Example coverage not shown since empty like coverage on class level was reported](https://gitlab.com/fh1ch/hello-inline-coverage-rust/-/merge_requests/1/diffs)** 

When the logic is changed to always add the complete class level line coverage ([via following diff](https://github.com/fh1ch/grcov/commit/0a64a1b16d34af6eb80a240a16feed2a0fda1713)), the report on GitLab works just fine: **[Example coverage shown](https://gitlab.com/fh1ch/hello-inline-coverage-rust/-/merge_requests/2/diffs)**

This fact also becomes apparent when bypassing the cobertura reporter by creating an lcov report first and using the [`lcov_cobertura` python module](https://github.com/eriwen/lcov-to-cobertura-xml) to create the final cobertura report:

```sh
grcov . --source-dir . --binary-path target/debug/ --branch --output-type lcov --output-path coverage.lcov
pip3 install lcov_cobertura
python3 -m lcov_cobertura coverage.lcov
```

This report contains the full class level line coverage and is hence also properly parsed by tools like GitLab.

You are a software tester at grcov and your are reviewing the above <patch> for the above <issue>.
A unit test has already been created for this PR and can be found alongside the filename and the imports used inside the <TEST> block.
It currently contains linting issues, which are inside the <output> block.
Your task is to:
1. Identify and understand the linting issue introduced by the unit test.
2. Update the unit test in the <TEST> block to resolve these issues.
3. The test must fail on the code before the patch, and pass after, hence the test will verify that the patch resolves the issue.
4. All 'use' declarations must be inside a <imports>...</imports> block. Additionally:
   - Do not use group imports.
  - Import only what is necessary for the test to run and make sure not to have colliding imports.
  - If the <patch> contains a 'mod tests' block with useful imports, do not add them to the <imports> block.
  - Use `use super::<function name> for the function under test.
.  - If multiple 'use' statements are needed, list each on a separate line.
5. To help you write the test, <Signatures> contains all modified function's:
  - name
  - parameters
  - Return type (assume '()' if empty)
6. Return only the absolute filename as it is in the <patch> block, the use statements, and rust test (no comments or explanations).

Follow this expected output format, do not deviate from this structure:
<Filename> ... </Filename>
<imports> ... </imports>
<Rust>
#[test]
fn test_<describe_behavior>() {
  <initialize required variables>;
  <define expected variable>;
  <generate actual variables>;
  <compare expected with actual>;
